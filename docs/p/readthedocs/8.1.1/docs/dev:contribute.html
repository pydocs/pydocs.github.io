<h1>Contributing to Read the Docs</h1>
               <p>Are you here to help on Read the Docs? Awesome!         <pre class='not-implemented'>&lt;SubstitutionRef: 
   |value: &#39;|:heart:|&#39;
   |&gt;</pre>
</p>

               <p>Read the Docs, and all of it&#39;s related projects, are all community maintained, open-source projects. We hope you feel welcome as you begin contributing to any of these projects. You&#39;ll find that development is primarily supported by our core team members, who all work on Read the Docs full-time.</p>

               <p>All members of our community are expected to follow our         <code class='verbatim'>/code-of-conduct</code>
. Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.</p>


<h2>Get in touch</h2>
               <p>If you have a question or comment, we generally suggest the following communication channels:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Ask usage questions (&#34;How do I?&#34;) on <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`StackOverflow`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Report bugs, suggest features, or view the source code <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`on GitHub`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Discuss development topics on <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Gitter`</code>.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _StackOverFlow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/read-the-docs&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _on GitHub: https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org&#39;&gt;

           </pre>


<h2>Contributing</h2>
               <p>There are plenty of places to contribute to Read the Docs, but if you are just starting with contributions, we suggest focusing on the following areas:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. contents:: 
    (&#39;local&#39;, &#39;&#39;)
    </pre>



<h3>Contributing to development</h3>
               <p>If you want to deep dive and help out with development on Read the Docs, then first get the project installed locally according to the         <code class='verbatim'>installation guide &lt;/install&gt;</code>
. After that is done we suggest you have a look at tickets in our issue tracker that are labelled <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Good
First Issue`</code>. These are meant to be a great way to get a smooth start and won&#39;t put you in front of the most complex parts of the system.</p>

               <p>If you are up to more challenging tasks with a bigger scope, then there are a set of tickets with a <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Feature`</code> or <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Improvement`</code> tag. These tickets have a general overview and description of the work required to finish. If you want to start somewhere, this would be a good place to start (make sure that the issue also have the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Accepted`</code> label). That said, these aren&#39;t necessarily the easiest tickets. They are simply things that are explained. If you still didn&#39;t find something to work on, search for the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Sprintable`</code> label. Those tickets are meant to be standalone and can be worked on ad-hoc.</p>

               <p>You can read all of our         <code class='verbatim'>/index</code>
 to understand more the development of Read the Docs. When contributing code, then please follow the standard Contribution Guidelines set forth at <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`contribution-guide.org`</code>.</p>

<h3>Contributing to documentation</h3>
               <p>Documentation for Read the Docs itself is hosted by Read the Docs at https://docs.readthedocs.io (likely the website you are currently reading).</p>

               <p>There are guidelines around writing and formatting documentation for the project. For full details, including how to build it, see         <code class='verbatim'>/docs</code>
.</p>


<h3>Contributing to translations</h3>
               <p>We use Transifex to manage localization for all of our projects that we support localization on. If you are interested in contributing, we suggest joining a team on one of <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`our projects on Transifex`</code>. From there, you can suggest translations, and can even be added as a reviewer, so you can correct and approve suggestions.</p>

               <p>If you don&#39;t see your language in our list of approved languages for any of our projects, feel free to suggest the language on Transifex to start the process.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _our projects on Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/readthedocs/&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>Triaging tickets</h2>
               <p>Core team uses the following guidelines for issue triage on all of our projects. These guidelines describe the issue lifecycle, and what is required at each step of this lifecycle.</p>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>You can ask one of the members of the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:doc:`team`</code> to give you access.</p>

</div>



<h3>Initial triage</h3>
               <p>When sitting down to do some triaging work, we start with the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`list of
untriaged tickets`</code>. We consider all tickets that do not have a label as untriaged. The first step is to categorize the ticket into one of the following categories and either close the ticket or assign an appropriate label. The reported issue …</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>… is not valid</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If you think the ticket is invalid comment why you think it is invalid,     then close the ticket. Tickets might be invalid if they were already fixed     in the past or it was decided that the proposed feature will not be     implemented because it does not conform with the overall goal of Read the     Docs. Also if you happen to know that the problem was already reported,     reference the other ticket that is already addressing the problem and close the duplicate.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Builds fail when using matplotlib</em>:       If the described issue was already fixed, then explain and instruct to       re-trigger the build.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><em>Provide way to upload arbitrary HTML files</em>:       It was already decided that Read the Docs is not a dull hosting platform       for HTML. So explain this and close the ticket.</p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
           </dl>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _triage-not-enough-information:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>… does not provide enough information</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Add the label <strong>Needed: more information</strong> if the reported issue does not     contain enough information to decide if it is valid or not and ask on the     ticket for the required information to go forward. We will re-triage all     tickets that have the label <strong>Needed: more information</strong> assigned. If the     original reporter left new information we can try to re-categorize the     ticket. If the reporter did not come back to provide more required     information after a long enough time, we will close the ticket (this will be     roughly about two weeks).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>My builds stopped working. Please help!</em>       Ask for a link to the build log and for which project is affected.</p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
               <dt><p>… is a valid feature proposal</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the ticket contains a feature that aligns with the goals     of Read the Docs, then add the label <strong>Feature</strong>. If the proposal     seems valid but requires further discussion between core contributors     because there might be different possibilities on how to implement the     feature, then also add the label <strong>Needed: design decision</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Provide better integration with service XYZ</em></p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><em>Achieve world domination</em> (also needs the label <strong>Needed: design
      decision</strong>)</p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
               <dt><p>… is a small change to the source code</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the ticket is about code cleanup or small changes to existing features     would likely have the <strong>Improvement</strong> label.     The distinction for this label is that these issues have a lower priority than a Bug,     and aren&#39;t implementing new features.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Refactor namedtuples to dataclasess</em></p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><em>Change font size for the project&#39;s title</em></p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
               <dt><p>… is a valid problem within the code base:</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If it&#39;s a valid bug, then add the label <strong>Bug</strong>. Try to reference related     issues if you come across any.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Builds fail if conf.py contains non-ascii letters</em></p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
               <dt><p>… is a currently valid problem with the infrastructure:</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Users might report about web server downtimes or that builds are not     triggered. If the ticket needs investigation on the servers, then add the     label <strong>Operations</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Builds are not starting</em></p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
           </dl>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _triage-support-tickets:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

               <!-- deflist -->

               <dt><p>… is a question and needs answering:</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the ticket contains a question about the Read the Docs platform or the     code, then add the label <strong>Support</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>My account was set inactive. Why?</em></p>

               <li>               <p><em>Why are my builds failing?</em></p>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
               <dt><p>… requires a one-time action on the server:</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Tasks that require a one time action on the server should be assigned the     two labels <strong>Support</strong> and <strong>Operations</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
           <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Please change my username</em></p>

</li>

</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
           </dl>

               <p>After we finished the initial triaging of new tickets, no ticket should be left without a label.</p>

           </pre>


<h3>Additional labels for categorization</h3>
               <p>Additionally to the labels already involved in the section above, we have a few more at hand to further categorize issues.</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p><em>High Priority</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the issue is urgent, assign this label. In the best case also go forward to     resolve the ticket yourself as soon as possible.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Good First Issue</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This label marks tickets that are easy to get started with. The ticket     should be ideal for beginners to dive into the code base. Better is if the     fix for the issue only involves touching one part of the code.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Sprintable</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Sprintable are all tickets that have the right amount of scope to be     handled during a sprint. They are very focused and encapsulated.</p>
</dd>
           </dl>

               <p>For a full list of available labels and their meanings, see         <code class='verbatim'>/issue-labels</code>

<h3>Helpful links for triaging</h3>
               <p>Here is a list of links for contributors that look for work:</p>

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
