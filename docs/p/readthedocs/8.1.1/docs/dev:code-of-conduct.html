<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
               <p>Like the technical community as a whole, the Read the Docs team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.</p>

               <p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.</p>

               <p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.</p>

               <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Read the Docs project. This includes live chat, mailing lists, the issue tracker, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person&#39;s ability to participate within them.</p>

               <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing dev@readthedocs.org.</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and    supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but    is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national    origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class,    educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and    expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and    mental and physical ability.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you    in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will    affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences    into account when making decisions. Remember that we&#39;re a world-wide    community, so you might not be communicating in someone else&#39;s    primary language.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but    disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We    might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot    allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important    to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or    threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Read the Docs community    should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with    people outside the Read the Docs community.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of    professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to    others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and    other exclusionary behavior aren&#39;t acceptable. This includes, but is    not limited to:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Discriminatory jokes and language.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people&#39;s personally       identifying information (&#34;doxing&#34;).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to       stop, then stop.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both    social and technical, happen all the time and Read the Docs is no exception.    It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views    constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Read the Docs    comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of    backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues.    Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean    that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming    each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to    resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
