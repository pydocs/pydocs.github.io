<h1>Policy for Abandoned Projects</h1>
               <p>This policy describes the process by which a Read the Docs project name may be changed.</p>


<h2>Rationale</h2>
               <p>Conflict between the current use of the name and a different suggested use of the same name occasionally arise.  This document aims to provide general guidelines for solving the most typical cases of such conflicts.</p>


<h2>Specification</h2>
               <p>The main idea behind this policy is that Read the Docs serves the community.  Every user is invited to upload content under the Terms of Use, understanding that it is at the sole risk of the user.</p>

               <p>While Read the Docs is not a backup service, the core team of Read the Docs does their best to keep that content accessible indefinitely in its published form. However, in certain edge cases the greater community&#39;s needs might outweigh the individual&#39;s expectation of ownership of a project name.</p>

               <p>The use cases covered by this policy are:</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Abandoned projects</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Renaming a project so that the original project name can be used by a     different project</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Active projects</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Resolving disputes over a name</p>
</dd>
           </dl>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Reachability</h3>
               <p>The user of Read the Docs is solely responsible for being reachable by the core team for matters concerning projects that the user owns. In every case where contacting the user is necessary, the core team will try to do so at least three times, using the following means of contact:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>E-mail address on file in the user&#39;s profile</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>E-mail addresses found in the given project&#39;s documentation</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>E-mail address on the project&#39;s home page</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>The core team will stop trying to reach the user after six weeks and the user will be considered <em>unreachable</em>.</p>


<h3>Abandoned projects</h3>
               <p>A project is considered <em>abandoned</em> when ALL of the following are met:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Owner is unreachable (see <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Reachability`</code>)</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The project has no proper documentation being served (no successful builds) or   does not have any releases within the past twelve months</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>No activity from the owner on the project&#39;s home page (or no home page   found).</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>All other projects are considered <em>active</em>.</p>


<h3>Renaming of an abandoned project</h3>
               <p>Projects are never renamed solely on the basis of abandonment.</p>

               <p>An <em>abandoned</em> project can be renamed (by appending         <code class='verbatim'>-abandoned</code>
 and a uniquifying integer if needed) for purposes of reusing the name when ALL of the following are met:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The project has been determined <em>abandoned</em> by the rules described above</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The candidate is able to demonstrate their own failed attempts to contact the   existing owner</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The candidate is able to demonstrate that the project suggested to reuse the   name already exists and meets notability requirements</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The candidate is able to demonstrate why a fork under a different name is not   an acceptable workaround</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The project has fewer than 100 monthly pageviews</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The core team does not have any additional reservations.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Name conflict resolution for active projects</h3>
               <p>The core team of Read the Docs are not arbiters in disputes around <em>active</em> projects. The core team recommends users to get in touch with each other and solve the issue by respectful communication.</p>


<h2>Prior art</h2>
               <p>The Python Package Index (PyPI) policy for claiming abandoned packages (<a link href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541" class='external'>PEP-0541</a>) heavily influenced this policy.</p>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
