<h1>DMCA Takedown Policy</h1>
               <p>These are the guidelines that Read the Docs follows when handling DMCA takedown requests and takedown counter requests. If you are a copyright holder wishing to submit a takedown request, or an author that has been notified of a takedown request, please familiarize yourself with <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`our process`</code>. You will be asked to confirm that you have reviewed information if you submit a request or counter request.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;__ `Takedown Process`_&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

               <p>We aim to keep this entire process as transparent as possible. Our process is modeled after <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`GitHub&#39;s DMCA takedown process`</code>, which we appreciate for its focus on transparency and fairness. All requests and counter requests will be posted to this page below, in the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Request Archive`</code>. These requests will be redacted to remove all identifying information, except for Read the Docs user and project names.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;__ https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>Takedown Process</h2>
               <p>Here are the steps the Read the Docs will follow in the takedown request process:</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Copyright holder submits a request</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This request, if valid, will be posted publicly on this page, <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`down below`</code>.     The author affected by the takedown request will be     notified with a link to the takedown request.</p>
<p>For more information on submitting a takedown request, see: <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Submitting a
    Request`</code></p>
</dd>
           </dl>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;__ `Request Archive`_&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Author is contacted</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>The author of the content in question will be asked to make changes to the     content specified in the takedown request. The author will have 24 hours to     make these changes. The copyright holder will be notified if and when this     process begins</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Author acknowledges changes have been made</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>The author must notify Read the Docs that changes have been made within 24     hours of receiving a takedown request. If the author does not respond to this     request, the default action will be to disable the Read the Docs project and     remove any hosted versions</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Copyright holder review</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the author has made changes, the copyright holder will be notified of     these changes. If the changes are sufficient, no further action is required,     though copyright holders are welcome to submit a formal retraction. If the     changes are not sufficient, the author&#39;s changes can be rejected. If the     takedown request requires alteration, a new request must be submitted.  If     Read the Docs does not receive a review response from the copyright holder     within 2 weeks, the default action at this step is to assume the takedown     request has been retracted.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Content may be disabled</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the author does not respond to a request for changes, or if the copyright     holder has rejected the author&#39;s changes during the review process, the     documentation project in question will be disabled.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Author submits a counter request</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If the author believes their content was disabled as a result of a mistake,     a counter request may be submitted. It would be advised that authors seek     legal council before continuing. If the submitted counter request is     sufficiently detailed, this counter will also be added to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`this page`</code>.     The copyright holder will be notified, with a link to     this counter request.</p>
<p>For more information on submitting a counter request, see: <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Submitting a
    Counter`</code></p>
</dd>
           </dl>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Copyright holder may file legal action</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>At this point, if the copyright holder wishes to keep the offending content     disabled, the copyright holder must file for legal action ordering the     author refrain from infringing activities on Read the Docs. The copyright     holder will have 2 weeks to supply Read the Docs with a copy of a valid legal     complaint against the author. The default action here, if the copyright     holder does not respond to this request, is to re-enable the author&#39;s     project.</p>
</dd>
           </dl>

<h2>Request Archive</h2>
               <p>Currently, Read the Docs has not received any takedown requests.</p>

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
