<h1>Overview of issue labels</h1>
               <p>Here is a full list of labels that we use in the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`GitHub issue tracker`</code> and what they stand for.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p><em>Accepted</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues with this label are issues that the core team has accepted on to the     roadmap. The core team focuses on accepted bugs, features, and improvements     that are on our immediate roadmap and will give priority to these issues.     Pull requests could be delayed or closed if the pull request doesn&#39;t align     with our current roadmap. An issue or pull request that has not been     accepted should either eventually move to an accepted state, or should be     closed. As an issue is accepted, we will find room for it on our roadmap,     either on an upcoming release (point release milestones), or on a future     milestone project (named milestones).</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Bug</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>An issue describing unexpected or malicious behaviour of the readthedocs.org     software. A Bug issue differs from an Improvement issue in that Bug issues     are given priority on our roadmap. On release, these issues generally only     warrant incrementing the patch level version.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Design</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues related to the UI of the readthedocs.org website.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Feature</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues that describe new features. Issues that do not describe new features,     such as code cleanup or fixes that are not related to a bug, should probably     be given the Improvement label instead. On release, issues with the Feature     label warrant at least a minor version increase.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Good First Issue</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This label marks issues that are easy to get started with. The issue     should be ideal for beginners to dive into the code base.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Priority: high</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues with this label should be resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Priority: low</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues with this label won&#39;t have the immediate focus of the core team.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Improvement</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>An issue with this label is not a Bug nor a Feature. Code cleanup or small     changes to existing features would likely have this label. The distinction     for this label is that these issues have a lower priority on our roadmap     compared to issues labeled Bug, and aren&#39;t implementing new features, such     as a Feature issue might.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Needed: design decision</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues that need a design decision are blocked for development until a     project leader clarifies the way in which the issue should be approached.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Needed: documentation</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>If an issue involves creating or refining documentation, this label will be     assigned.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Needed: more information</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This label indicates that a reply with more information is required from the     bug reporter. If no response is given by the reporter, the issue is     considered invalid after 2 weeks and will be closed. See the documentation     about our         <code class='verbatim'>triage process &lt;triage-not-enough-information&gt;</code>
 for more     information.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Needed: patch</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This label indicates that a patch is required in order to resolve the     issue. A fix should be proposed via a pull request on GitHub.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Needed: tests</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This label indicates that a better test coverage is required to resolve     the issue. New tests should be proposed via a pull request on GitHub.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Needed: replication</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This label indicates that a bug has been reported, but has not been     successfully replicated by another user or contributor yet.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Operations</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Issues that require changes in the server infrastructure.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>PR: work in progress</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Pull requests that are not complete yet. A final review is not possible     yet, but every pull request is open for discussion.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>PR: hotfix</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Pull request was applied directly to production after a release. These pull     requests still need review to be merged into the next release.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Sprintable</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Sprintable are all issues that have the right amount of scope to be     handled during a sprint. They are very focused and encapsulated.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Status: blocked</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>The issue cannot be resolved until some other issue has been closed.     See the issue&#39;s log for which issue is blocking this issue.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Status: stale</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>A issue is stale if it there has been no activity on it for 90 days. Once a     issue is determined to be stale, it will be closed after 2 weeks unless     there is activity on the issue.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p><em>Support</em></p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Questions that needs answering but do not require code changes or issues     that only require a one time action on the server will have this label.     See the documentation about our         <code class='verbatim'>triage process

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
