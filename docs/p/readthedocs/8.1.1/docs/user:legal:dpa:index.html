               <p>If Read the Docs becomes aware of any Personal Data Breach involving Organization Data, Read the Docs will promptly, and in no case more than five calendar days after becoming aware, notify Organization in writing of the Personal Data Breach. Following such notification, to the extent required by applicable Data Protection Laws, Read the Docs will: (a) provide Organization with timely information relating to such Personal Data Breach as it becomes known or is reasonably requested by Organization; and (b) upon Organization’s request, provide Organization with commercially reasonable assistance as necessary to enable Organization to notify authorities and/or affected Data Subjects. Each Party shall be solely responsible for all costs, damages, and liabilities incurred as the result of a Personal Data Breach of the Party’s own information system and shall, at the other Party’s request and cost, provide the other Party with reasonable assistance to investigate, respond to, and mitigate the effects of a Breach of the other Party’s information system.</p>

Organization shall reimburse Read the Docs for the commercially reasonable costs arising from this assistance. If a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the Processing of Organization Data under the Agreement is made directly to Read the Docs, Read the Docs will promptly inform Organization and will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Organization.

                          <ol>               <li>               <p><strong>Roles of the Parties.</strong> When Processing European Data under the    Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Organization is    the Controller and Read the Docs is the Processor.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Sub-Processors.</strong> In addition to the provisions of Section 7,    Read the Docs will notify Organization of any changes to    Sub-processors engaged to Process European Data by updating the    Sub-Processor List and posting the changes for Organization’s    review. Organization may object to the engagement of a new    Sub-Processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of    Personal Data within 30 days after posting the updated    Sub-Processor List. If Organization so objects, the Parties will    discuss Organization&#39;s concerns in good faith with a view to    achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such    resolution can be reached, Read the Docs will, at its sole    discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit    Organization to suspend or terminate the Agreement without    liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees    incurred by Organization prior to suspension or termination).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Data Transfers.</strong> In addition to Section 9, for transfers of    European Personal Data to Read the Docs for processing by Read    the Docs in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU,    the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing    “adequate” data protection, Read the Docs agrees it will (i) use    the form of the Controller-to-Processor SCCs or (ii) provide at    least the same level of privacy protection for European Personal    Data as required under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield    frameworks, as applicable. If such data transfers rely on    Controller-to-Processor SCCs to enable the lawful transfer of    European Personal Data, as set forth in the preceding sentence,    the Parties agree that Data Subjects for whom Read the Docs    Processes European Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries    under the Controller-to-Processor SCCs. If Read the Docs is    unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then    (a) Read the Docs shall notify Organization of such inability and    (b) any movement of European Personal Data to a non-EU country    requires the prior written consent of Organization.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultation with
   Supervisory Authorities.</strong> To the extent that the required    information is reasonably available to Read the Docs, and    Organization does not otherwise have access to the required    information, Read the Docs will provide reasonable assistance to    Organization with any data protection impact assessments, and    prior consultations with supervisory authorities or other    competent data privacy authorities to the extent required by    European Data Protection Laws.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>California Personal Information</p>

            </ol>

                        <hr/>


               <p>This Section 16 applies only with respect to Processing of California Personal Information by Read the Docs in Read the Docs’s capacity as a Service Provider.</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p><strong>Roles of the Parties.</strong> When Processing California Personal    Information in accordance with Organization&#39;s Instructions, the    Parties acknowledge and agree that Organization is a Business and    Read the Docs is the Service Provider for the purposes of the    CCPA. Additionally, for the purposes of interpreting this DPA    with respect to Processing of California Personal Information,    the term “Controller” is replaced with “Business” and “Processor”    is replaced with “Service Provider” wherever those terms appear    in Sections 2 through 14 and Section 17 of this DPA.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Responsibilities.</strong> The Parties agree that Read the Docs will    process Users’ California Personal Information as a Service    Provider strictly for the business purpose of performing the    Services under the Agreement and as set forth in Read the Docs’s    Privacy Policy. The Parties agree that Read the Docs shall not    (i) “sell” or “share” Users’ California Personal Information (as    those terms are defined in the CCPA); (ii) retain, use, or    disclose Users’ California Personal Information for a commercial    purpose other than for such business purpose or as otherwise    permitted by the CCPA; or (iii) retain, use, or disclose Users’    California Personal Information outside of the direct business    relationship between Organization and Read the Docs.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>Certification.</strong> Read the Docs hereby certifies that it    understands and will comply with the restrictions of Section    16(b).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><strong>No CCPA Sale.</strong> The Parties agree that Organization does not    sell California Personal Information to Read the Docs because, as    a Service Provider, Read the Docs may only use California    Personal Information for the purposes of providing the Services    to Organization.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>General</p>

</li>
            </ol>

               <p>Organization represents that it is authorized to, and hereby agrees to, enter into and be bound by this DPA for and on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates and subsidiaries, thereby establishing a separate DPA between Read the Docs and Organization and each of Organization’s affiliates and subsidiaries subject to the Agreement, as applicable. The relationship between Parties is that of independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be interpreted to constitute the Parties as partners, joint venturers, principal-agent, or otherwise participants in a common undertaking, or, except as expressly provided herein, allow either Party to create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other for any purpose whatsoever. The limitations of liability set forth in the Agreement shall apply to Read the Docs’s liability arising out of or relating to this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses (where applicable), taken in the aggregate along with the Agreement and any other agreement between the Parties. In case of any conflict or inconsistency with the terms of the Agreement, this DPA shall take precedence over the terms of the Agreement to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency. If any individual provisions of this DPA are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this DPA shall not be affected. We periodically update this Agreement. If you are a current Organization, you will be informed of any modification by email, alert on the Organization dashboard or portal or by other means.</p>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
