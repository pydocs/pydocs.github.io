<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>My project isn&#39;t building correctly</h2>
               <p>First, you should check out the Builds tab of your project. That records all of the build attempts that RTD has made to build your project. If you see         <code class='verbatim'>ImportError</code>
 messages for custom Python modules, see our section on         <code class='verbatim'>faq:My documentation requires additional dependencies</code>
.</p>

               <p>If you are still seeing errors because of C library dependencies, please see         <code class='verbatim'>faq:I get import errors on libraries that depend on C modules</code>
.</p>


<h2>Help, my build passed but my documentation page is 404 Not Found!</h2>
               <p>This often happens because you don&#39;t have an <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`index.html`</code> file being generated. Make sure you have one of the following files:</p>

                           <blockquote>           <ul>               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`index.rst`</code></p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`index.md`</code></p>

</li>
            </ul>
</blockquote>

               <p>At the top level of your built documentation, otherwise we aren&#39;t able to serve a &#34;default&#34; index page.</p>

               <p>To test if your docs actually built correctly, you can navigate to a specific page (<code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`/en/latest/README.html`</code> for example).</p>


<h2>My documentation requires additional dependencies</h2>
               <p>For most Python dependencies, you can can specify a requirements file which details your dependencies. See our guide on         <code class='verbatim'>guides/reproducible-builds:using a configuration file</code>
. You can also set your project documentation to install your project itself as a dependency.</p>

               <p>Your build may depend on extensions that require additional system packages to be installed. If you are using a         <code class='verbatim'>Configuration File &lt;config-file/v2&gt;</code>
 you can         <code class='verbatim'>add libraries with apt &lt;config-file/v2:build.apt_packages&gt;</code>
 to the Ubuntu-based builder .</p>

               <p>If your project or its dependencies rely on C libraries that cannot be installed this way, see         <code class='verbatim'>faq:I get import errors on libraries that depend on C modules</code>
.</p>


<h2>My project requires some additional settings</h2>
               <p>If this is just a dependency issue, see         <code class='verbatim'>faq:My documentation requires additional dependencies</code>
.</p>

               <p>Read the Docs offers some settings which can be used for a variety of purposes. To enable these settings, please send an email to support@readthedocs.org and we will change the settings for the project. Read more about these settings         <code class='verbatim'>here &lt;feature-flags&gt;</code>
.</p>


<h2>I get import errors on libraries that depend on C modules</h2>
                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>Another use case for this is when you have a module with a C extension.</p>

</div>


               <p>This happens because the build system does not have the dependencies for building your project, such as C libraries needed by some Python packages (e.g.         <code class='verbatim'>libevent</code>
 or         <code class='verbatim'>mysql</code>
). For libraries that cannot be         <code class='verbatim'>installed via apt
&lt;config-file/v2:build.apt_packages&gt;</code>
 in the builder there is another way to successfully build the documentation despite missing dependencies.</p>

               <p>With Sphinx you can use the built-in <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`autodoc_mock_imports`</code> for mocking. If such libraries are installed via         <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
, you also will need to remove all the C-dependent libraries from your         <code class='verbatim'>install_requires</code>
 in the RTD environment.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _autodoc_mock_imports: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_mock_imports&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>How do I change behavior when building with Read the Docs?</h2>
               <p>When RTD builds your project, it sets the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:envvar:`READTHEDOCS`</code> environment variable to the string         <code class='verbatim'>&#39;True&#39;</code>
. So within your Sphinx         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
 file, you can vary the behavior based on this. For example:      </p>

               <pre>import os
on_rtd = os.environ.get(&#39;READTHEDOCS&#39;) == &#39;True&#39;
if on_rtd:
    html_theme = &#39;default&#39;
else:
    html_theme = &#39;nature&#39;</pre>
               <p>The <code class='not-implemented'>:None:envvar:`READTHEDOCS`</code> variable is also available in the Sphinx build environment, and will be set to         <code class='verbatim'>True</code>
 when building on RTD:      </p>

               <pre>{% if READTHEDOCS %}
Woo
{% endif %}</pre>

<h2>`Client Error 401` when building documentation</h2>
               <p>If you did not install the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`test_data`</code> fixture during the installation instructions, you will get the following error:      </p>

               <pre>slumber.exceptions.HttpClientError: Client Error 401: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/version/</pre>
               <p>This is because the API admin user does not exist, and so cannot authenticate. You can fix this by loading the test_data:      </p>

               <pre>./manage.py loaddata test_data</pre>
               <p>If you&#39;d prefer not to install the test data, you&#39;ll need to provide a database account for the builder to use. You can provide these credentials by editing the following settings:      </p>

               <pre>SLUMBER_USERNAME = &#39;test&#39;
SLUMBER_PASSWORD = &#39;test&#39;</pre>

<h2>How do I host multiple projects on one custom domain?</h2>
               <p>We support the concept of subprojects, which allows multiple projects to share a single domain. If you add a subproject to a project, that documentation will be served under the parent project&#39;s subdomain or custom domain.</p>

               <p>For example, Kombu is a subproject of Celery, so you can access it on the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`celery.readthedocs.io`</code> domain:</p>

               <p>https://celery.readthedocs.io/projects/kombu/en/latest/</p>

               <p>This also works the same for custom domains:</p>

               <p>http://docs..org/projects/kombu/en/latest/</p>

               <p>You can add subprojects in the project admin dashboard.</p>

               <p>For details on custom domains, see our documentation on         <code class='verbatim'>/custom_domains</code>
.</p>


<h2>Where do I need to put my docs for RTD to find it?</h2>
               <p>Read the Docs will crawl your project looking for a         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
. Where it finds the         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
, it will run         <code class='verbatim'>sphinx-build</code>
 in that directory. So as long as you only have one set of sphinx documentation in your project, it should Just Work.</p>

               <p>You can specify an exact path to your documentation using a Read the Docs         <code class='verbatim'>config-file/index</code>
.</p>


<h2>I want to use the Blue/Default Sphinx theme</h2>
               <p>We think that our theme is badass, and better than the default for many reasons. Some people don&#39;t like change though         <pre class='not-implemented'>&lt;SubstitutionRef: 
   |value: &#39;|:smile:|&#39;
   |&gt;</pre>
, so there is a hack that will let you keep using the default theme. If you set the         <code class='verbatim'>html_style</code>
 variable in your         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
, it should default to using the default theme. The value of this doesn&#39;t matter, and can be set to         <code class='verbatim'>/default.css</code>
 for default behavior.</p>


<h2>I want to use the Read the Docs theme locally</h2>
               <p>There is a repository for that: https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme. Simply follow the instructions in the README.</p>


<h2>Image scaling doesn&#39;t work in my documentation</h2>
               <p>Image scaling in docutils depends on PIL. PIL is installed in the system that RTD runs on. However, if you are using the virtualenv building option, you will likely need to include PIL in your requirements for your project.</p>


<h2>I want comments in my docs</h2>
               <p>RTD doesn&#39;t have explicit support for this. That said, a tool like <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Disqus`</code> (and the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`sphinxcontrib-disqus`</code> plugin) can be used for this purpose on RTD.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _Disqus: https://disqus.com/&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _sphinxcontrib-disqus: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-disqus&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>How do I support multiple languages of documentation?</h2>
               <p>See the section on         <code class='verbatim'>localization</code>
.</p>


<h2>Does Read the Docs work well with &#34;legible&#34; docstrings?</h2>
               <p>Yes. One criticism of Sphinx is that its annotated docstrings are too dense and difficult for humans to read. In response, many projects have adopted customized docstring styles that are simultaneously informative and legible. The <a link href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard" class='external'>NumPy</a> and <a link href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings" class='external'>Google</a> styles are two popular docstring formats.  Fortunately, the default Read the Docs theme handles both formats just fine, provided your         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
 specifies an appropriate Sphinx extension that knows how to convert your customized docstrings.  Two such extensions are <a link href="https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc" class='external'>numpydoc</a> and <a link href="http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io" class='external'>napoleon</a>. Only         <code class='verbatim'>napoleon</code>
 is able to handle both docstring formats. Its default output more closely matches the format of standard Sphinx annotations, and as a result, it tends to look a bit better with the default theme.</p>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>To use these extensions you need to specify the dependencies on your project by following this <code class='not-implemented'>:None:ref:`guide &lt;guides/reproducible-builds:using a configuration file&gt;`</code>.</p>

</div>



<h2>Can I document a Python package that is not at the root of my repository?</h2>
               <p>Yes. The most convenient way to access a Python package for example via <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Sphinx&#39;s autoapi`</code> in your documentation is to use the <em>Install your project
inside a virtualenv using setup.py install</em> option in the admin panel of your project. However this assumes that your         <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
 is in the root of your repository.</p>

               <p>If you want to place your package in a different directory or have multiple Python packages in the same project, then create a pip requirements file. You can specify the relative path to your package inside the file. For example you want to keep your Python package in the         <code class='verbatim'>src/python</code>
 directory, then create a         <code class='verbatim'>requirements.txt</code>
 file with the following contents:      </p>

               <pre>src/python/</pre>
               <p>Please note that the path must be relative to the working directory where         <code class='verbatim'>pip</code>
 is launched, rather than the directory where the requirements file is located. Therefore, even if you want to move the requirements file to a         <code class='verbatim'>requirements/</code>
 directory, the example path above would work.</p>

               <p>You can customize the path to your requirements file and any other installed dependency using a Read the Docs         <code class='verbatim'>config-file/index</code>
.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#34;.. _Sphinx&#39;s autoapi: http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html&#34;&gt;
           </pre>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _pip requirements file: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#requirements-files&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>I need to install a package in a environment with pinned versions</h2>
               <p>To ensure proper installation of a Python package, the         <code class='verbatim'>pip</code>
         <code class='verbatim'>install method &lt;config-file/v2:python.install&gt;</code>
 will automatically upgrade every dependency to its most recent version in case they aren&#39;t pinned by the package definition. If instead you&#39;d like to pin your dependencies outside the package, you can add this line to your requirements or environment file (if you are using Conda).</p>

               <p>In your         <code class='verbatim'>requirements.txt</code>
 file:      </p>

               <pre># path to the directory containing setup.py relative to the project root
-e .</pre>
               <p>In your Conda environment file (        <code class='verbatim'>environment.yml</code>
):      </p>

               <pre># path to the directory containing setup.py relative to the environment file
-e ..</pre>

<h2>Can I use Anaconda Project and ``anaconda-project.yml``?</h2>
               <p>Yes. With         <code class='verbatim'>anaconda-project&gt;=0.8.4</code>
 you can use the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Anaconda Project`</code> configuration file         <code class='verbatim'>anaconda-project.yaml</code>
 (or         <code class='verbatim'>anaconda-project.yml</code>
) directly in place of a Conda environment file by using         <code class='verbatim'>dependencies:</code>
 as an alias for         <code class='verbatim'>packages:</code>
.</p>

               <p>I.e., your         <code class='verbatim'>anaconda-project.yaml</code>
 file can be used as a         <code class='verbatim'>conda.environment</code>
 config in the         <code class='verbatim'>.readthedocs.yaml</code>
 config file if it contains:      </p>

               <pre>dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - scipy
  ...</pre>
                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _Anaconda Project: https://anaconda-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>How can I avoid search results having a deprecated version of my docs?</h2>
               <p>If readers search something related to your docs in Google, it will probably return the most relevant version of your documentation. It may happen that this version is already deprecated and you want to stop Google indexing it as a result, and start suggesting the latest (or newer) one.</p>

               <p>To accomplish this, you can add a         <code class='verbatim'>robots.txt</code>
 file to your documentation&#39;s root so it ends up served at the root URL of your project (for example, https://yourproject.readthedocs.io/robots.txt). We have documented how to set this up in our         <code class='verbatim'>hosting:Custom robots.txt Pages</code>
 docs.</p>


<h2>Can I remove advertising from my documentation?</h2>
               <p>See         <code class='verbatim'>Opting out of advertising &lt;advertising/ethical-advertising:Opting Out&gt;</code>
.</p>


<h2>How do I change my project slug (the URL your docs are served at)?</h2>
               <p>We don&#39;t support allowing folks to change the slug for their project. You can update the name which is shown on the site, but not the actual URL that documentation is served.</p>

               <p>The main reason for this is that all existing URLs to the content will break. You can delete and re-create the project with the proper name to get a new slug, but you really shouldn&#39;t do this if you have existing inbound links, as it <a link href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html" class='external'>breaks the internet</a>.</p>

               <p>If that isn&#39;t enough, you can request the change sending an email to support@readthedocs.org.</p>


<h2>How do I change the version slug of my project?</h2>
               <p>We don&#39;t support allowing folks to change the slug for their versions. But you can rename the branch/tag to achieve this. If that isn&#39;t enough, you can request the change sending an email to support@readthedocs.org.</p>


<h2>What commit of Read the Docs is in production?</h2>
               <p>We deploy readthedocs.org from the         <code class='verbatim'>rel</code>
 branch in our GitHub repository. You can see the latest commits that have been deployed by looking on GitHub: https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/commits/rel</p>

               <p>We also keep an up-to-date         <code class='verbatim'>changelog &lt;/changelog&gt;</code>
.</p>


<h2>How can I deploy Jupyter Book projects on Read the Docs?</h2>
               <p>According to <a link href="https://jupyterbook.org/" class='external'>its own documentation</a>,</p>

                           <blockquote><p>Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful,    publication-quality books and documents from computational material.</p>
</blockquote>

               <p>Even though <a link href="https://jupyterbook.org/explain/sphinx.html#jupyter-book-is-a-distribution-of-sphinx" class='external'>Jupyter Book leverages Sphinx &#34;for almost everything that it
does&#34;</a>, it purposedly hides Sphinx         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
 files from the user, and instead generates them on the fly from its declarative         <code class='verbatim'>_config.yml</code>
. As a result, you need to follow some extra steps to make Jupyter Book work on Read the Docs.</p>

               <p>As described in         <code class='verbatim'>the official documentation &lt;jupyterbook:publish/readthedocs&gt;</code>
, you can manually convert your Jupyter Book project to Sphinx with the following command:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. code-block:: console
    $ jupyter-book config sphinx path/to/book</pre>


               <p>and then commit the resulting         <code class='verbatim'>conf.py</code>
 to git. Alternatively, you can set up some automation that does it for every change, for example         <code class='verbatim'>using pre-commit &lt;jupyterbook:sphinx:convert:pre-commit&gt;</code>
.</p>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
