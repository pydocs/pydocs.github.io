<h1>EthicalAds</h1>
               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. meta:: 
    (&#39;description lang=en&#39;, &#34;To fund Read the Docs, we built an ad platform that doesn&#39;t track users and respects their privacy.&#34;)
    </pre>


               <p>Read the Docs is a large, free web service. There is one proven business model to support this kind of site: <strong>Advertising</strong>. We are building the advertising model we want to exist, and we&#39;re calling it <strong>EthicalAds</strong>.</p>

               <p><strong>EthicalAds respect users while providing value to advertisers.</strong> We don&#39;t track you, sell your data, or anything else. We simply show ads to users, based on the content of the pages you look at. We also give 10% of our ad space to         <code class='verbatim'>community projects &lt;advertising/ethical-advertising:Community Ads&gt;</code>
, as our way of saying thanks to the open source community.</p>

               <p>We talk a bit below about         <code class='verbatim'>our worldview on advertising &lt;advertising/ethical-advertising:Our Worldview&gt;</code>
, if you want to know more.</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. admonition:: Are you a marketer?
    We built a `whole business &lt;https://www.ethicalads.io/?ref=rtd-docs&gt;`_
    around privacy-focused advertising.
    If you&#39;re trying to reach developers, we have a network of hand-approved sites (including Read the Docs)
    where your ads are shown.</pre>



<h2>Feedback</h2>
               <p>We&#39;re a community, and we value your feedback. If you ever want to reach out about this effort, feel free to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`shoot us an email &lt;mailto:rev@readthedocs.org&gt;`</code>.</p>

               <p>You can         <code class='verbatim'>opt out &lt;advertising/ethical-advertising:Opting out&gt;</code>
 of having paid ads on your projects, or seeing paid ads if you want. You will still see         <code class='verbatim'>community ads &lt;advertising/ethical-advertising:Community Ads&gt;</code>
, which we run for free that promote community projects.</p>


<h2>Our Worldview</h2>
               <p>We&#39;re building the advertising model we want to exist:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>We don&#39;t track you</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We don&#39;t sell your data</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We host everything ourselves, no third-party scripts or images</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p><strong>We&#39;re doing newspaper advertising,
on the internet.</strong> For a hundred years, newspapers put an ad on the page, some folks would see it, and advertisers would pay for this. This is our model.</p>

               <p>So much ad tech has been built to track users. Following them across the web, from site to site, showing the same ads and gathering data about them. Then retailers sell your purchase data to try and attribute sales to advertising. Now there is an industry in doing <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`fake ad clicks`</code> and other scams, which leads the ad industry to track you even more intrusively to know more about you. The current advertising industry is in a vicious downward spiral.</p>

               <p>As developers, we understand the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`massive downsides`</code> of the current advertising industry. This includes malware, slow site performance, and huge databases of your personal data being sold to the highest bidder.</p>

               <p>The trend in advertising is to have larger and larger ads. They should run before your content, they should take over the page, the bigger, weirder, or flashier the better.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>

           </pre>


<h3>We opt out</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>We don&#39;t store personal information about you.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We only keep track of views and clicks.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We don&#39;t build a profile of your personality to sell ads against.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We only show high quality ads from companies that are of interest to developers.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>We are running a single, small, unobtrusive ad on documentation pages. The products should be interesting to you. The ads won&#39;t flash or move.</p>

               <p>We run the ads we want to have on our site, in a way that makes us feel good.</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>We have additional documentation on the           <code class='verbatim'>technical details of our advertising &lt;advertising-details&gt;</code>
   including our Do Not Track policy and our use of analytics.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We have an <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`advertising FAQ`</code> written for advertisers.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h2>Community Ads</h2>
               <p>There are a large number of projects, conferences, and initiatives that we care about in the software and open source ecosystems. A large number of them operate like we did in the past, with almost no income. Our Community Ads program will highlight some of these projects.</p>

               <p>There are a few qualifications for our Community Ads program:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Your organization and the linked site should not be trying to entice   visitors to buy a product or service.   We make an exception for conferences around open source projects   if they are run not for profit and soliciting donations for open source projects.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A software project should have an <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`OSI approved license`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We will not run a community ad for an organization tied   to one of our paid advertisers.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>We&#39;ll show 10% of our ad inventory each month to support initiatives that we care about. Please <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`complete an application`</code> to be considered for our Community Ads program.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _OSI approved license: https://opensource.org/licenses&#39;&gt;

           </pre>


<h2>Opting Out</h2>
               <p>We have added multiple ways to opt out of the advertising on Read the Docs.</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>You can go completely ad-free    by becoming a <a link href="https://readthedocs.org/accounts/gold/" class='external'>Gold member</a>    or a <a link href="https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/#donations" class='external'>Supporter</a>.    Additionally, Gold members may remove advertising from their projects for all visitors.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>You can opt out of seeing paid advertisements on documentation pages:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Go to the drop down user menu in the top right of the Read the Docs dashboard and clicking <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Settings`</code> (https://readthedocs.org/accounts/edit/).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>On the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Advertising`</code> tab, you can deselect <strong>See paid advertising</strong>.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>You will still see         <code class='verbatim'>community ads &lt;advertising/ethical-advertising:Community Ads&gt;</code>
    for open source projects and conferences.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Project owners can also opt out of paid advertisements for their projects.    You can change these options:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Go to your <strong>project</strong> page (<code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`/projects/&lt;slug&gt;/`</code>)</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Go to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Admin`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Advertising`</code></p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Change your advertising settings</p>

</li>
            </ul>

</li>
               <li>               <p>If you are part of a company that uses Read the Docs to host documentation for a commercial product,    we offer         <code class='verbatim'>Read the Docs for Business &lt;/commercial/index&gt;</code>
 that offers a completely ad-free experience,    additional build resources, and other great features like CDN support and private documentation.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>If you would like to completely remove advertising from your open source project,    but our commercial plans don&#39;t seem like the right fit,    please <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`get in touch`</code> to discuss alternatives to advertising.</p>

</li>
            </ol>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _get in touch: mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Alternatives%20to%20advertising&#39;&gt;

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
