<h1>Read the Docs Terms of Service</h1>
               <p>Effective date: <strong>September 30, 2019</strong></p>

               <p>Thank you for using Read the Docs! We&#39;re happy you&#39;re here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using Read the Docs. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. contents:: Table of contents
    (&#39;local&#39;, &#39;&#39;)
    (&#39;backlinks&#39;, &#39;none&#39;)
    (&#39;depth&#39;, &#39;1&#39;)
    </pre>



<h2>Definitions</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement,
and they have specific meanings.
You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.
There&#39;s not going to be a test on it, but it&#39;s still useful information.</em></p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>The &#34;Agreement&#34; refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices    contained or referenced in this document (the &#34;Terms of Service&#34; or the &#34;Terms&#34;)    and all other operating rules, policies    (including our         <code class='verbatim'>privacy-policy</code>
)    and procedures that we may publish from time to time on our sites.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Our &#34;Service&#34; or &#34;Services&#34; refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Read the Docs    (see         <code class='verbatim'>Our services &lt;terms-of-service:Our services&gt;</code>
).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The &#34;Website&#34; or &#34;Websites&#34; refers to Read the Docs&#39; websites located at    readthedocs.org, readthedocs.com, Documentation Sites,    and all content, services, and products provided by Read the Docs at or through those Websites.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>&#34;The User,&#34; &#34;You,&#34; and &#34;Your&#34; refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using ours Websites or Services;    that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.    A User must be at least 13 years of age.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>&#34;Read the Docs,&#34; &#34;We,&#34; and &#34;Us&#34; refer to Read the Docs, Inc.,    as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>&#34;Content&#34; refers to content featured or displayed through the Websites,    including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features,    and other materials that are available on our Websites or otherwise available through our Services.    &#34;Content&#34; also includes Services. &#34;User-Generated Content&#34; is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users.    &#34;Your Content&#34; is Content that you create or own.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>An &#34;Account&#34; represents your legal relationship with Read the Docs.    A &#34;User Account&#34; represents an individual User&#39;s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User&#39;s identity on Read the Docs.    &#34;Organizations&#34; are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once.    A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>&#34;User Personal Information&#34; is any information about one of our users which could,    alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.    Information such as a user name and password, an email address,    a real name, and a photograph are examples of User Personal Information.    Our         <code class='verbatim'>privacy-policy</code>
 goes into more details on User Personal Information,    what data Read the Docs collects, and why we collect it.</p>

</li>
            </ol>


<h3>Our services</h3>
               <p>Read the Docs is made up of the following Websites:</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>readthedocs.org (&#34;Read the Docs Community&#34;)</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This Website is used by documentation authors and project maintainers for     writing and distributing technical documentation.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>readthedocs.com (&#34;Read the Docs for Business&#34;)</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>This Website is a commercial hosted offering for hosting private     documentation for corporate clients.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>readthedocs.io, readthedocs-hosted.com, and other domains (&#34;Documentation Sites&#34;)</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>These Websites are where Read the Docs hosts         <code class='verbatim'>terms-of-service:User-Generated Content</code>
     on behalf of documentation authors.</p>
</dd>
           </dl>


<h2>Account terms</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls;
a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over;
and you must provide a valid email address.
You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account.
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</em></p>


<h3>Account controls</h3>
               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Users</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Organizations</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>The &#34;owner&#34; of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it.     Within our Services, an owner can manage User access to the Organization&#39;s data and projects.     An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization.     If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</p>
</dd>
           </dl>


<h3>Required information</h3>
               <p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a         <code class='verbatim'>paid Account &lt;terms-of-service:Payment&gt;</code>
, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>


<h3>Account requirements</h3>
               <p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on Read the Docs&#39; Services.</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>You must be a human to create an Account.   Accounts registered by &#34;bots&#34; or other automated methods are not permitted.   We do permit machine accounts:</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account,   provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions.   A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks.   Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account,   but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine&#39;s actions.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young developers and authors get excited by learning to program,   we must comply with United States law.   Read the Docs does not target our Services to children under 13,   and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.   If we learn of any User under the age of 13,   we will have to close your account.   If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country&#39;s minimum age may be older;   in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country&#39;s laws.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>You may not use Read the Docs in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.   You may not use Read the Docs if you are or are working on behalf of a <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Specially Designated National (SDN)`</code>   or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency.   Read the Docs may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain Read the Docs services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _Specially Designated National (SDN): https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h3>User Account security</h3>
               <p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password.   Read the Docs cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>You will promptly         <code class='verbatim'>notify Read the Docs &lt;/security&gt;</code>
 if you become aware of any unauthorized use of,   or access to, our Services through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Additional terms</h3>
               <p>In some situations, third parties&#39; terms may apply to your use of Read the Docs. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Read the Docs with its own terms or license agreements; or you may download an application that integrates with Read the Docs. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties&#39; terms govern their relationships with you.</p>


<h2>Acceptable use</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>Read the Docs hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world,
and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith.
While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section,
which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations.
In short, be excellent to each other.</em></p>

               <p>Your use of our Websites and Services must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>


<h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it,
so that we can display and share the content and documentation you post.
You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it,
and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service.
We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.</em></p>


<h3>Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h3>
               <p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>


<h3>Read the Docs may remove Content</h3>
               <p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Read the Docs terms or policies.</p>


<h3>Ownership of Content, right to post, and license grants</h3>
               <p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you&#39;re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>

               <p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Read the Docs Users — certain legal permissions, listed below (in         <code class='verbatim'>License grant to us &lt;terms-of-service:License grant to us&gt;</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>License grant to other users &lt;terms-of-service:License grant to other users&gt;</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>Moral rights &lt;terms-of-service:Moral rights&gt;</code>
). These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Read the Docs the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.</p>


<h3>License grant to us</h3>
               <p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>

               <p>This license does not grant Read the Docs the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>


<h3>License grant to other users</h3>
               <p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by others. By setting your projects to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your Content.</p>

               <p>On Read the Docs Community, all Content is public.</p>


<h3>Moral rights</h3>
               <p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of our Services, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in         <code class='verbatim'>License grant to us &lt;terms-of-service:License grant to us&gt;</code>
, but not otherwise.</p>

               <p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Read the Docs the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render our Websites and provide our Services.</p>


<h2>Private projects</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You may connect Read the Docs for Business to your private repositories or host documentation privately.
We treat the content of these private projects as confidential,
and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.</em></p>


<h3>Confidentiality of private projects</h3>
               <p>Read the Docs considers the contents of private projects to be confidential to you. Read the Docs will protect the contents of private projects from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>


<h3>Access</h3>
               <p>Read the Docs employees may only access the content of your private projects in the following situations:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons.   If Read the Docs accesses a private project for support reasons,   we will only do so with the owner&#39;s consent and knowledge.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>When access is required for security reasons,   including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality,   integrity, availability and resilience of Read the Docs&#39; systems and Services.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Exclusions</h3>
               <p>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private project are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be         <code class='verbatim'>compelled by law &lt;privacy-policy:How we respond to compelled disclosure&gt;</code>
 to disclose the contents of your private projects.</p>


<h2>Copyright infringement and DMCA policy</h2>
               <p>If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright or other rights, please contact us in accordance with our         <code class='verbatim'>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy &lt;/dmca/index&gt;</code>
. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.</p>

               <p>We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.</p>


<h2>Intellectual property notice</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We own the Service and all of our Content.
In order for you to use our Content, we give you certain rights to it,
but you may only use our Content in the way we have allowed.</em></p>


<h3>Read the Docs&#39; rights to content</h3>
               <p>Read the Docs and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to our Websites and Services. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law.</p>


<h3>Read the Docs trademarks and logos</h3>
               <p>If you&#39;d like to use Read the Docs&#39;s trademarks, you must follow all of our <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`trademark guidelines`</code>.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _trademark guidelines: https://read-the-docs-guidelines.readthedocs-hosted.com/&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>API terms</h2>
               <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You agree to these Terms of Service,
plus this Section, when using any of Read the Docs&#39; APIs (Application Provider Interface),
including use of the API through a third party product that accesses Read the Docs.</em></p>


<h3>No abuse or overuse of the API</h3>

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
