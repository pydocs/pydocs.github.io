<h1>Security</h1>
               <p>Security is very important to us at Read the Docs. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. In the spirit of transparency, we are committed to responsible reporting and disclosure of security issues.</p>

<h2>Security issue archive</h2>

<h3>Version 5.19.0</h3>
               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>changelog:Version 5.19.0</code>
 fixes an issue that allowed a malicious user to fetch internal and private information from a logged user in readthedocs.org/readthedocs.com by creating a malicious site hosted on readthedocs.io/readthedocs-hosted.com or from any custom domain registered in the platform.</p>

               <p>It would have required the attacker to get a logged in user to visit an attacker controlled web page, which could then have made GET API requests on behalf of the user. This vulnerability was found by our team as part of a routine security audit, and there is no indication it was exploited.</p>

               <p>The issue was found by the Read the Docs team.</p>


<h3>Version 5.14.0</h3>
               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>changelog:Version 5.14.0</code>
 fixes an issue where that affected new code that removed multiple slashes in URL paths. The issue allowed the creation of hyperlinks that looked like they would go to a documentation domain on Read the Docs (either <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`*.readthedocs.io`</code> or a [custom docs domain](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/custom_domains.html)) but instead went to a different domain.</p>

               <p>This issue was reported by Splunk after it was reported by a security audit.</p>


<h3>Version 3.5.1</h3>
               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>changelog:Version 3.5.1</code>
 fixed an issue that affected projects with &#34;prefix&#34; or &#34;sphinx&#34; user-defined redirects. The issue allowed the creation of hyperlinks that looked like they would go to a documentation domain on Read the Docs (either         <code class='verbatim'>*.readthedocs.io</code>
 or a custom docs domain) but instead went to a different domain.</p>

               <p>This issue was reported by Peter Thomassen and the desec.io DNS security project and was funded by <a link href="https://www.securesystems.de" class='external'>SSE</a>.</p>


<h3>Version 3.2.0</h3>
               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>changelog:Version 3.2.0</code>
 resolved an issue where a specially crafted request could result in a DNS query to an arbitrary domain.</p>

               <p>This issue was found by <a link href="https://www.cybersmartdefence.com/" class='external'>Cyber Smart Defence</a> who reported it as part of a security audit to a firm running a local installation of Read the Docs.</p>


<h3>Release 2.3.0</h3>
               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>changelog:Version 2.3.0</code>
 resolves a security issue with translations on our community hosting site that allowed users to modify the hosted path of a target project by adding it as a translation project of their own project. A check was added to ensure project ownership before adding the project as a translation.</p>

               <p>In order to add a project as a translation now, users must now first be granted ownership in the translation project.</p>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
