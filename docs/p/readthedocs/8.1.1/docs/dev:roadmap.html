<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<h2>Process</h2>
               <p>Read the Docs has adopted the following workflow with regards to how we prioritize our development efforts and where the core development team focuses its time.</p>


<h3>Triaging issues</h3>
               <p>Much of this is already covered in our guide on         <code class='verbatim'>contribute</code>
, however to summarize the important pieces:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>New issues coming in will be triaged, but won&#39;t yet be considered part of our   roadmap.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>If the issue is a valid bug, it will be assigned the         <code class='verbatim'>Accepted</code>
 label and   will be prioritized, likely on an upcoming point release.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>If the issues is a feature or improvement, the issue might go through a design   decision phase before being accepted and assigned to a milestone. This is a   good time to discuss how to address the problem technically. Skipping this   phase might result in your PR being blocked, sent back to design decision, or   perhaps even discarded. It&#39;s best to be active here before submitting a PR for   a feature or improvement.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The core team will only work on accepted issues, and will give PR review   priority to accepted issues. Pull requests addressing issues that are not on   our roadmap are welcome, but we cannot guarantee review response, even for   small or easy to review pull requests.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Milestones</h3>
               <p>We maintain two types of milestones: point release milestones for our upcoming releases, and group milestones, for blocks of work that have priority in the future.</p>

               <p>Generally there are 2 or 3 point release milestones lined up. These point releases dictate the issues that core team has discussed as priority already. Core team should not focus on issues outside these milestones as that implies either the issue was not discussed as a priority, or the issue isn&#39;t a priority.</p>

               <p>We follow <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`semantic versioning`</code> for our release numbering and our point release milestones follow these guidelines. For example, our next release milestones might be         <code class='verbatim'>2.8</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>2.9</code>
, and         <code class='verbatim'>3.0</code>
. Releases         <code class='verbatim'>2.8</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>2.9</code>
 will contain bug fix issues and one backwards compatible feature (this dictates the change in minor version). Release         <code class='verbatim'>3.0</code>
 will contain bugfixes and at least one backwards incompatible change.</p>

               <p>Point release milestones try to remain static, but can shift upwards on a release that included an unexpected feature addition. Sometimes the resulting PR unexpectedly includes changes that dictate a minor version increment though, according to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`semantic versioning`</code>. In this case, the current milestone is closed, future milestones are increased a minor point if necessary, and the remaining milestone issues are migrated to a new milestone for the next upcoming release number.</p>

               <p>Group milestones are blocks of work that will have priority in the future, but aren&#39;t included on point releases yet. When the core team does decide to make these milestones a priority, they will be moved into point release milestones.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _semantic versioning: https://semver.org&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h3>Where to contribute</h3>
               <p>It&#39;s best to pick off an issue from our current point release or group milestones, to ensure your pull request gets attention. You can also feel free to contribute on our Cleanup or Refactoring milestones. Though not a development priority, these issues are generally discrete, easier to jump into than feature development, and we especially appreciate outside contributions here as these milestones are not a place the core team can justify spending time in development currently.</p>


<h2>Current roadmap</h2>
               <p>In addition to the point release milestones currently established, our current roadmap priorities also include:</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Admin UX</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/16</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Search Improvements</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/23</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>YAML File Completion</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/28</p>
</dd>
           </dl>

               <p>There are also several milestones that are explicitly <em>not</em> a priority for the core team:</p>

               <!-- deflist -->
           <dl>
               <dt><p>Cleanup</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/10</p>
</dd>
               <dt><p>Refactoring</p>
</dt>
               <dd><p>https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/34</p>
</dd>
           </dl>

               <p>Core team will not be focusing their time on these milestones in development.</p>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
