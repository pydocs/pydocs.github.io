<h1>Single Sign-On</h1>
                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>This feature only exists on <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Read the Docs for Business &lt;https://readthedocs.com/&gt;`</code>.</p>

</div>


               <p>Single sign-on is supported on         <pre class='not-implemented'>&lt;SubstitutionRef: 
   |value: &#39;|com_brand|&#39;
   |&gt;</pre>
 for all users. <code class='not-implemented'>:None:abbr:`SSO (single sign-on)`</code> will allow you to grant permissions to your organization&#39;s projects in an easy way.</p>

               <p>Currently, we support two different types of single sign-on:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Authentication <em>and</em> authorization are managed by the identity provider (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab)</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Authentication (<em>only</em>) is managed by the identity provider (e.g. an active Google Workspace account with a verified email address)</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>Users can log out by using the         <code class='verbatim'>Log Out &lt;versions:Logging out&gt;</code>
 link in the RTD flyout menu.</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>

    (&#39;local&#39;, &#39;&#39;)
    (&#39;depth&#39;, &#39;2&#39;)
    </pre>



<h2>SSO with VCS provider (GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab)</h2>
               <p>Using an identity provider that supports authentication and authorization allows you to manage who has access to projects on Read the Docs, directly from the provider itself. If a user needs access to your documentation project on Read the Docs, that user just needs to be granted permissions in the VCS repository associated with the project.</p>

               <p>You can enable this feature in your organization by going to your organization&#39;s detail page &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Settings`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Authorization`</code> and selecting <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket`</code> as provider.</p>

               <p>Note the users created under Read the Docs must have their GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab         <code class='verbatim'>account connected &lt;/connected-accounts&gt;</code>
 in order to make SSO work.  You can read more about <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`granting permissions on GitHub`</code>.</p>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>warning</div>
</div>


                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _granting permissions on GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h3>Grant access to read the documentation</h3>
               <p>By granting <strong>read</strong> (or more) permissions to a user in the VCS repository you are giving access to read the documentation of the associated project on Read the Docs to that user.</p>


<h3>Grant access to administrate a project</h3>
               <p>By granting <strong>write</strong> permission to a user in the VCS repository you are giving access to read the documentation <em>and</em> to be an administrator of the associated project on Read the Docs to that user.</p>


<h3>Grant access to import a project</h3>
               <p>When SSO with a VCS provider is enabled, only owners of the Read the Docs organization can import projects. Adding users as owners of your organization will give them permissions to import projects.</p>

               <p>Note that to be able to import a project, that user must have <strong>admin</strong> permissions in the VCS repository associated.</p>


<h3>Revoke access to a project</h3>
               <p>If a user should not have access anymore to a project, for any reason, a VCS repository&#39;s admin (e.g. user with Admin role on GitHub for that specific repository) can revoke access to the VCS repository and this will be automatically reflected in Read the Docs.</p>

               <p>The same process is followed in case you need to remove <strong>admin</strong> access, but still want that user to have access to read the documentation. Instead of revoking access completely, just need lower down permissions to <strong>read</strong> only.</p>


<h2>SSO with Google Workspace</h2>
                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
</div>


               <p>Using your company&#39;s Google email address (e.g.         <code class='verbatim'>employee@company.com</code>
) allows you to manage authentication for your organization&#39;s members. As this identity provider does not provide authorization over each repositories/projects per user, permissions are managed by the         <code class='verbatim'>internal Read the Docs&#39;s teams &lt;commercial/organizations:Team Types&gt;</code>
 authorization system.</p>

               <p>By default, users that sign up with a Google account do not have any permissions over any project. However, you can define which teams users matching your company&#39;s domain email address will auto-join when they sign up. Read the following sections to learn how to grant read and admin access.</p>

               <p>You can enable this feature in your organization by going to your organization&#39;s detail page &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Settings`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Authorization`</code> and selecting <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Google`</code> as provider and specifying your Google Workspace domain in the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Domain`</code> field.</p>


<h3>Grant access to read a project</h3>
               <p>You can add a user under a read-only team to grant <strong>read</strong> permissions to all the projects under that team. This can be done under your organization&#39;s detail page &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Teams`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Read Only`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Invite Member`</code>.</p>

               <p>To avoid this repetitive task for each employee of your company, the owner of the Read the Docs organization can mark one or many teams for users matching the company&#39;s domain email to join these teams automaically when they sign up.</p>

               <p>For example, you can create a team with the projects that all employees of your company should have access to and mark it as <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Auto join users with an organization&#39;s email address to this team`</code>. Then all users that sign up with their         <code class='verbatim'>employee@company.com</code>
 email will automatically join this team and have <strong>read</strong> access to those projects.</p>


<h3>Grant access to administer a project</h3>
               <p>You can add a user under an admin team to grant <strong>admin</strong> permissions to all the projects under that team. This can be done under your organization&#39;s detail page &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Teams`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Admins`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Invite Member`</code>.</p>


<h3>Grant access to users to import a project</h3>
               <p>Making the user member of any admin team under your organization (as mentioned in the previous section), they will be granted access to import a project.</p>

               <p>Note that to be able to import a project, that user must have <strong>admin</strong> permissions in the GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab repository associated, and their social account connected with Read the Docs.</p>


<h3>Revoke user&#39;s access to a project</h3>
               <p>To revoke access to a project for a particular user, you should remove that user from the team that contains that project. This can be done under your organization&#39;s detail page &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Teams`</code> &gt; <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Read Only`</code> and click <code class='not-implemented'>:None:guilabel:`Remove`</code> next to the user you want to revoke access.</p>


<h3>Revoke user&#39;s access to all the projects</h3>
               <p>By disabling the Google Workspace account with email         <code class='verbatim'>employee@company.com</code>
, you revoke access to all the projects that user had access and disable login on Read the Docs completely for that user.</p>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
