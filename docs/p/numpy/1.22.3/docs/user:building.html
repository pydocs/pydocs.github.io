           </pre>


<h1>Building from source</h1>
               <p>There are two options for building NumPy- building with Gitpod or locally from source. Your choice depends on your operating system and familiarity with the command line.</p>


<h1>Gitpod</h1>
               <p>Gitpod is an open-source platform that automatically creates the correct development environment right in your browser, reducing the need to install local development environments and deal with incompatible dependencies.</p>

               <p>If you are a Windows user, unfamiliar with using the command line or building NumPy for the first time, it is often faster to build with Gitpod. Here are the in-depth instructions for building NumPy with <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`building NumPy with Gitpod`</code>.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _building NumPy with Gitpod: https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_gitpod.html&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Building locally</h1>
               <p>Building locally on your machine gives you more granular control. If you are a MacOS or Linux user familiar with using the command line, you can continue with building NumPy locally by following the instructions below.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Comment: 
   |value: &#39;..\n  This page is referenced from numpy/numpy/__init__.py. Please keep its\n  location in sync with the link there.&#39;
   |&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
               <p>Building NumPy requires the following software installed:</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>Python 3.8.x or newer</p>

               <p>Please note that the Python development headers also need to be installed,    e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu one needs to install both <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`python3`</code> and    <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`python3-dev`</code>. On Windows and macOS this is normally not an issue.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Compilers</p>

               <p>Much of NumPy is written in C.  You will need a C compiler that complies    with the C99 standard.</p>

               <p>Part of Numpy is now written in C++. You will also need a C++ compiler that    complies with the C++11 standard.</p>

               <p>While a FORTRAN 77 compiler is not necessary for building NumPy, it is    needed to run the         <code class='verbatim'>numpy.f2py</code>
 tests. These tests are skipped if the    compiler is not auto-detected.</p>

               <p>Note that NumPy is developed mainly using GNU compilers and tested on    MSVC and Clang compilers. Compilers from other vendors such as Intel,    Absoft, Sun, NAG, Compaq, Vast, Portland, Lahey, HP, IBM are only    supported in the form of community feedback, and may not work out of the    box.  GCC 4.x (and later) compilers are recommended. On ARM64 (aarch64)    GCC 8.x (and later) are recommended.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Linear Algebra libraries</p>

               <p>NumPy does not require any external linear algebra libraries to be    installed. However, if these are available, NumPy&#39;s setup script can detect    them and use them for building. A number of different LAPACK library setups    can be used, including optimized LAPACK libraries such as OpenBLAS or MKL.    The choice and location of these libraries as well as include paths and    other such build options can be specified in a         <code class='verbatim'>site.cfg</code>
 file located in    the NumPy root repository or a         <code class='verbatim'>.numpy-site.cfg</code>
 file in your home    directory. See the         <code class='verbatim'>site.cfg.example</code>
 example file included in the NumPy    repository or sdist for documentation, and below for specifying search    priority from environmental variables.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Cython</p>

               <p>For building NumPy, you&#39;ll need a recent version of Cython.</p>

</li>
            </ol>


<h1>Basic Installation</h1>
               <p>To install NumPy, run::      </p>

               <pre>pip install .</pre>
               <p>To perform an in-place build that can be run from the source folder run::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py build_ext --inplace</pre>
               <p><em>Note: for build instructions to do development work on NumPy itself, see</em>         <code class='verbatim'>development-environment</code>
.</p>


<h1>Testing</h1>
               <p>Make sure to test your builds. To ensure everything stays in shape, see if all tests pass.</p>

               <p>The test suite requires additional dependencies, which can easily be  installed with::      </p>

               <pre>$ python -m pip install -r test_requirements.txt</pre>
               <p>Run tests::      </p>

               <pre>$ python runtests.py -v -m full</pre>
               <p>For detailed info on testing, see         <code class='verbatim'>testing-builds</code>
.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _parallel-builds:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Parallel builds</h1>
               <p>It&#39;s possible to do a parallel build with::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py build -j 4 install --prefix $HOME/.local</pre>
               <p>This will compile numpy on 4 CPUs and install it into the specified prefix. to perform a parallel in-place build, run::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py build_ext --inplace -j 4</pre>
               <p>The number of build jobs can also be specified via the environment variable         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_NUM_BUILD_JOBS</code>
.</p>


<h1>Choosing the fortran compiler</h1>
               <p>Compilers are auto-detected; building with a particular compiler can be done with         <code class='verbatim'>--fcompiler</code>
.  E.g. to select gfortran::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95</pre>
               <p>For more information see::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py build --help-fcompiler</pre>

<h1>How to check the ABI of BLAS/LAPACK libraries</h1>
               <p>One relatively simple and reliable way to check for the compiler used to build a library is to use ldd on the library. If libg2c.so is a dependency, this means that g77 has been used (note: g77 is no longer supported for building NumPy). If libgfortran.so is a dependency, gfortran has been used. If both are dependencies, this means both have been used, which is almost always a very bad idea.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _accelerated-blas-lapack-libraries:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Accelerated BLAS/LAPACK libraries</h1>
               <p>NumPy searches for optimized linear algebra libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK. There are specific orders for searching these libraries, as described below and in the         <code class='verbatim'>site.cfg.example</code>
 file.</p>


<h1>BLAS</h1>
               <p>Note that both BLAS and CBLAS interfaces are needed for a properly optimized build of NumPy.</p>

               <p>The default order for the libraries are:</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>MKL</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>BLIS</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>OpenBLAS</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>ATLAS</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>BLAS (NetLIB)</p>

</li>
            </ol>

               <p>The detection of BLAS libraries may be bypassed by defining the environment variable         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_BLAS_LIBS</code>
 , which should contain the exact linker flags you want to use (interface is assumed to be Fortran 77).  Also define         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_CBLAS_LIBS</code>
 (even empty if CBLAS is contained in your BLAS library) to trigger use of CBLAS and avoid slow fallback code for matrix calculations.</p>

               <p>If you wish to build against OpenBLAS but you also have BLIS available one may predefine the order of searching via the environment variable         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_BLAS_ORDER</code>
 which is a comma-separated list of the above names which is used to determine what to search for, for instance::        </p>

               <pre>NPY_BLAS_ORDER=ATLAS,blis,openblas,MKL python setup.py build</pre>
               <p>will prefer to use ATLAS, then BLIS, then OpenBLAS and as a last resort MKL. If neither of these exists the build will fail (names are compared lower case).</p>

               <p>Alternatively one may use         <code class='verbatim'>!</code>
 or         <code class='verbatim'>^</code>
 to negate all items::          </p>

               <pre>NPY_BLAS_ORDER=&#39;^blas,atlas&#39; python setup.py build</pre>
               <p>will allow using anything <strong>but</strong> NetLIB BLAS and ATLAS libraries, the order of the above list is retained.</p>

               <p>One cannot mix negation and positives, nor have multiple negations, such cases will raise an error.</p>


<h1>LAPACK</h1>
               <p>The default order for the libraries are:</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>MKL</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>OpenBLAS</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>libFLAME</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>ATLAS</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>LAPACK (NetLIB)</p>

</li>
            </ol>

               <p>The detection of LAPACK libraries may be bypassed by defining the environment variable         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_LAPACK_LIBS</code>
, which should contain the exact linker flags you want to use (language is assumed to be Fortran 77).</p>

               <p>If you wish to build against OpenBLAS but you also have MKL available one may predefine the order of searching via the environment variable         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_LAPACK_ORDER</code>
 which is a comma-separated list of the above names, for instance::        </p>

               <pre>NPY_LAPACK_ORDER=ATLAS,openblas,MKL python setup.py build</pre>
               <p>will prefer to use ATLAS, then OpenBLAS and as a last resort MKL. If neither of these exists the build will fail (names are compared lower case).</p>

               <p>Alternatively one may use         <code class='verbatim'>!</code>
 or         <code class='verbatim'>^</code>
 to negate all items::          </p>

               <pre>NPY_LAPACK_ORDER=&#39;^lapack&#39; python setup.py build</pre>
               <p>will allow using anything <strong>but</strong> the NetLIB LAPACK library, the order of the above list is retained.</p>

               <p>One cannot mix negation and positives, nor have multiple negations, such cases will raise an error.</p>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>deprecated</div>
        <p>The native libraries on macOS, provided by Accelerate, are not fit for use in NumPy since they have bugs that cause wrong output under easily reproducible conditions. If the vendor fixes those bugs, the library could be reinstated, but until then users compiling for themselves should use another linear algebra library or use the built-in (but slower) default, see the next section.</p>

</div>



<h1>Disabling ATLAS and other accelerated libraries</h1>
               <p>Usage of ATLAS and other accelerated libraries in NumPy can be disabled via::      </p>

               <pre>NPY_BLAS_ORDER= NPY_LAPACK_ORDER= python setup.py build</pre>
               <p>or::      </p>

               <pre>BLAS=None LAPACK=None ATLAS=None python setup.py build</pre>

<h1>64-bit BLAS and LAPACK</h1>
               <p>You can tell Numpy to use 64-bit BLAS/LAPACK libraries by setting the environment variable::      </p>

               <pre>NPY_USE_BLAS_ILP64=1</pre>
               <p>when building Numpy. The following 64-bit BLAS/LAPACK libraries are supported:</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>OpenBLAS ILP64 with         <code class='verbatim'>64_</code>
 symbol suffix (        <code class='verbatim'>openblas64_</code>
)</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>OpenBLAS ILP64 without symbol suffix (        <code class='verbatim'>openblas_ilp64</code>
)</p>

</li>
            </ol>

               <p>The order in which they are preferred is determined by         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_BLAS_ILP64_ORDER</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_LAPACK_ILP64_ORDER</code>
 environment variables. The default value is         <code class='verbatim'>openblas64_,openblas_ilp64</code>
.</p>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>Using non-symbol-suffixed 64-bit BLAS/LAPACK in a program that also uses 32-bit BLAS/LAPACK can cause crashes under certain conditions (e.g. with embedded Python interpreters on Linux).</p>

        <p>The 64-bit OpenBLAS with         <code class='verbatim'>64_</code>
 symbol suffix is obtained by compiling OpenBLAS with settings::      </p>

        <pre>make INTERFACE64=1 SYMBOLSUFFIX=64_</pre>
        <p>The symbol suffix avoids the symbol name clashes between 32-bit and 64-bit BLAS/LAPACK libraries.</p>

</div>



<h1>Supplying additional compiler flags</h1>
               <p>Additional compiler flags can be supplied by setting the         <code class='verbatim'>OPT</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>FOPT</code>
 (for Fortran), and         <code class='verbatim'>CC</code>
 environment variables. When providing options that should improve the performance of the code ensure that you also set         <code class='verbatim'>-DNDEBUG</code>
 so that debugging code is not executed.</p>


<h1>Cross compilation</h1>
               <p>Although         <code class='verbatim'>numpy.distutils</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>setuptools</code>
 do not directly support cross compilation, it is possible to build NumPy on one system for different architectures with minor modifications to the build environment. This may be desirable, for example, to use the power of a high-performance desktop to create a NumPy package for a low-power, single-board computer. Because the         <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
 scripts are unaware of cross-compilation environments and tend to make decisions based on the environment detected on the build system, it is best to compile for the same type of operating system that runs on the builder. Attempting to compile a Mac version of NumPy on Windows, for example, is likely to be met with challenges not considered here.</p>

               <p>For the purpose of this discussion, the nomenclature adopted by <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`meson`</code> will be used: the &#34;build&#34; system is that which will be running the NumPy build process, while the &#34;host&#34; is the platform on which the compiled package will be run. A native Python interpreter, the setuptools and Cython packages and the desired cross compiler must be available for the build system. In addition, a Python interpreter and its development headers as well as any external linear algebra libraries must be available for the host platform. For convenience, it is assumed that all host software is available under a separate prefix directory, here called         <code class='verbatim'>$CROSS_PREFIX</code>
.</p>

               <p>When building and installing NumPy for a host system, the         <code class='verbatim'>CC</code>
 environment variable must provide the path the cross compiler that will be used to build NumPy C extensions. It may also be necessary to set the         <code class='verbatim'>LDSHARED</code>
 environment variable to the path to the linker that can link compiled objects for the host system. The compiler must be told where it can find Python libraries and development headers. On Unix-like systems, this generally requires adding, <em>e.g.</em>, the following parameters to the         <code class='verbatim'>CFLAGS</code>
 environment variable::      </p>

               <pre>-I${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/include
-I${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/include/python3.y</pre>
               <p>for Python version 3.y. (Replace the &#34;y&#34; in this path with the actual minor number of the installed Python runtime.) Likewise, the linker should be told where to find host libraries by adding a parameter to the         <code class='verbatim'>LDFLAGS</code>
 environment variable::      </p>

               <pre>-L${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/lib</pre>
               <p>To make sure Python-specific system configuration options are provided for the intended host and not the build system, set::      </p>

               <pre>_PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME=_sysconfigdata_${ARCH_TRIPLET}</pre>
               <p>where         <code class='verbatim'>${ARCH_TRIPLET}</code>
 is an architecture-dependent suffix appropriate for the host architecture. (This should be the name of a         <code class='verbatim'>_sysconfigdata</code>
 file, without the         <code class='verbatim'>.py</code>
 extension, found in the host Python library directory.)</p>

               <p>When using external linear algebra libraries, include and library directories should be provided for the desired libraries in         <code class='verbatim'>site.cfg</code>
 as described above and in the comments of the         <code class='verbatim'>site.cfg.example</code>
 file included in the NumPy repository or sdist. In this example, set::      </p>

               <pre>include_dirs = ${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/include
library_dirs = ${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/lib</pre>
               <p>under appropriate sections of the file to allow         <code class='verbatim'>numpy.distutils</code>
 to find the libraries.</p>

               <p>As of NumPy 1.22.0, a vendored copy of SVML will be built on         <code class='verbatim'>x86_64</code>
 Linux hosts to provide AVX-512 acceleration of floating-point operations. When using an         <code class='verbatim'>x86_64</code>
 Linux build system to cross compile NumPy for hosts other than         <code class='verbatim'>x86_64</code>
 Linux, set the environment variable         <code class='verbatim'>NPY_DISABLE_SVML</code>
 to prevent the NumPy build script from incorrectly attempting to cross-compile this platform-specific library::      </p>

               <pre>NPY_DISABLE_SVML=1</pre>
               <p>With the environment configured, NumPy may be built as it is natively::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py build</pre>
               <p>When the         <code class='verbatim'>wheel</code>
 package is available, the cross-compiled package may be packed into a wheel for installation on the host with::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py bdist_wheel</pre>
               <p>It may be possible to use         <code class='verbatim'>pip</code>
 to build a wheel, but         <code class='verbatim'>pip</code>
 configures its own environment; adapting the         <code class='verbatim'>pip</code>
 environment to cross-compilation is beyond the scope of this guide.</p>

               <p>The cross-compiled package may also be installed into the host prefix for cross-compilation of other packages using, <em>e.g.</em>, the command::      </p>

               <pre>python setup.py install --prefix=${CROSS_PREFIX}</pre>
               <p>When cross compiling other packages that depend on NumPy, the host npy-pkg-config file must be made available. For further discussion, refer to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`numpy distutils documentation`</code>.</p>

<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
