                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _development-workflow:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Development workflow</h1>
               <p>You already have your own forked copy of the <code>:None:None:`NumPy_`</code> repository, by following         <code class='verbatim'>forking</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>set-up-fork</code>
, you have configured <code>:None:None:`git_`</code> by following         <code class='verbatim'>configure-git</code>
, and have linked the upstream repository as explained in         <code class='verbatim'>linking-to-upstream</code>
.</p>

               <p>What is described below is a recommended workflow with Git.</p>


<h1>Basic workflow</h1>
               <p>In short:</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>Start a new <em>feature branch</em> for each set of edits that you do.    See         <code class='verbatim'>below &lt;making-a-new-feature-branch&gt;</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Hack away! See         <code class='verbatim'>below &lt;editing-workflow&gt;</code>
</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>When finished:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Contributors</em>: push your feature branch to your own Github repo, and              <code class='verbatim'>create a pull request &lt;asking-for-merging&gt;</code>
.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p><em>Core developers</em>: If you want to push changes without      further review, see the notes         <code class='verbatim'>below &lt;pushing-to-main&gt;</code>
.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

</li>
            </ol>

               <p>This way of working helps to keep work well organized and the history as clear as possible.</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. seealso:: 
    There are many online tutorials to help you `learn git`_. For discussions
    of specific git workflows, see these discussions on `linux git workflow`_,
    and `ipython git workflow`_.</pre>


                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _making-a-new-feature-branch:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Making a new feature branch</h1>
               <p>First, fetch new commits from the         <code class='verbatim'>upstream</code>
 repository:</p>

               <pre>git fetch upstream</pre>
               <p>Then, create a new branch based on the main branch of the upstream repository::     </p>

               <pre>git checkout -b my-new-feature upstream/main</pre>
                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _editing-workflow:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>The editing workflow</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>
               <pre># hack hack
git status # Optional
git diff # Optional
git add modified_file
git commit
# push the branch to your own Github repo
git push origin my-new-feature</pre>

<h1>In more detail</h1>
                          <ol>               <li>               <p>Make some changes. When you feel that you&#39;ve made a complete, working set    of related changes, move on to the next steps.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Optional: Check which files have changed with         <code class='verbatim'>git status</code>
 (see <code>:None:None:`git
   status`</code>).  You&#39;ll see a listing like this one::       </p>

               <pre># On branch my-new-feature
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use &#34;git add &lt;file&gt;...&#34; to update what will be committed)
#   (use &#34;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&#34; to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use &#34;git add &lt;file&gt;...&#34; to include in what will be committed)
#
#	INSTALL
no changes added to commit (use &#34;git add&#34; and/or &#34;git commit -a&#34;)</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>Optional: Compare the changes with the previous version using with         <code class='verbatim'>git
   diff</code>
 (<code>:None:None:`git diff`</code>). This brings up a simple text browser interface that    highlights the difference between your files and the previous version.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Add any relevant modified or new files using          <code class='verbatim'>git add modified_file</code>
    (see <code>:None:None:`git add`</code>). This puts the files into a staging area, which is a queue    of files that will be added to your next commit. Only add files that have    related, complete changes. Leave files with unfinished changes for later    commits.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>To commit the staged files into the local copy of your repo, do         <code class='verbatim'>git
   commit</code>
. At this point, a text editor will open up to allow you to write a    commit message. Read the         <code class='verbatim'>commit message
   section&lt;writing-the-commit-message&gt;</code>
 to be sure that you are writing a    properly formatted and sufficiently detailed commit message. After saving    your message and closing the editor, your commit will be saved. For trivial    commits, a short commit message can be passed in through the command line    using the         <code class='verbatim'>-m</code>
 flag. For example,         <code class='verbatim'>git commit -am &#34;ENH: Some message&#34;</code>
.</p>

               <p>In some cases, you will see this form of the commit command:         <code class='verbatim'>git commit
   -a</code>
. The extra         <code class='verbatim'>-a</code>
 flag automatically commits all modified files and    removes all deleted files. This can save you some typing of numerous         <code class='verbatim'>git
   add</code>
 commands; however, it can add unwanted changes to a commit if you&#39;re    not careful. For more information, see <code>:None:None:`why the -a flag?`</code> - and the    helpful use-case description in the <code>:None:None:`tangled working copy problem`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Push the changes to your forked repo on <code>:None:None:`github_`</code>        </p>

               <pre>git push origin my-new-feature</pre>
               <p>For more information, see <code>:None:None:`git push`</code>.</p>

</li>
            </ol>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>Assuming you have followed the instructions in these pages, git will create a default link to your <code>:None:None:`github_`</code> repo called         <code class='verbatim'>origin</code>
.  In git &gt;= 1.7 you can ensure that the link to origin is permanently set by using the         <code class='verbatim'>--set-upstream</code>
 option::     </p>

        <pre>git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature</pre>
        <p>From now on <code>:None:None:`git_`</code> will know that         <code class='verbatim'>my-new-feature</code>
 is related to the         <code class='verbatim'>my-new-feature</code>
 branch in your own <code>:None:None:`github_`</code> repo. Subsequent push calls are then simplified to the following::     </p>

        <pre>git push</pre>
        <p>You have to use         <code class='verbatim'>--set-upstream</code>
 for each new branch that you create.</p>

</div>


               <p>It may be the case that while you were working on your edits, new commits have been added to         <code class='verbatim'>upstream</code>
 that affect your work. In this case, follow the         <code class='verbatim'>rebasing-on-main</code>
 section of this document to apply those changes to your branch.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _writing-the-commit-message:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Writing the commit message</h1>
               <p>Commit messages should be clear and follow a few basic rules.  Example::     </p>

               <pre>ENH: add functionality X to numpy.&lt;submodule&gt;.

The first line of the commit message starts with a capitalized acronym
(options listed below) indicating what type of commit this is.  Then a blank
line, then more text if needed.  Lines shouldn&#39;t be longer than 72
characters.  If the commit is related to a ticket, indicate that with
&#34;See #3456&#34;, &#34;See ticket 3456&#34;, &#34;Closes #3456&#34; or similar.</pre>
               <p>Describing the motivation for a change, the nature of a bug for bug fixes or some details on what an enhancement does are also good to include in a commit message.  Messages should be understandable without looking at the code changes.  A commit message like         <code class='verbatim'>MAINT: fixed another one</code>
 is an example of what not to do; the reader has to go look for context elsewhere.</p>

               <p>Standard acronyms to start the commit message with are::     </p>

               <pre>API: an (incompatible) API change
BENCH: changes to the benchmark suite
BLD: change related to building numpy
BUG: bug fix
DEP: deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
DEV: development tool or utility
DOC: documentation
ENH: enhancement
MAINT: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.)
REV: revert an earlier commit
STY: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
TST: addition or modification of tests
TYP: static typing
REL: related to releasing numpy</pre>

<h1>Commands to skip continuous integration</h1>
               <p>By default a lot of continuous integration (CI) jobs are run for every PR, from running the test suite on different operating systems and hardware platforms to building the docs. In some cases you already know that CI isn&#39;t needed (or not all of it), for example if you work on CI config files, text in the README, or other files that aren&#39;t involved in regular build, test or docs sequences. In such cases you may explicitly skip CI by including one of these fragments in your commit message::     </p>

               <pre>``[ci skip]``: skip as much CI as possible (not all jobs can be skipped)
``[skip github]``: skip GitHub Actions &#34;build numpy and run tests&#34; jobs
``[skip travis]``: skip TravisCI jobs
``[skip azurepipelines]``: skip Azure jobs</pre>
               <p><em>Note</em>: unfortunately not all CI systems implement this feature well, or at all. CircleCI supports         <code class='verbatim'>ci skip</code>
 but has no command to skip only CircleCI. Azure chooses to still run jobs with skip commands on PRs, the jobs only get skipped on merging to master.</p>


<h1>Test building wheels</h1>
               <p>Numpy currently uses <a link href="https://https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class='external'>cibuildwheel</a> in order to build wheels through continuous integration services. To save resources, the cibuildwheel wheel builders are not run by default on every single PR or commit to main.</p>

               <p>If you would like to test that your pull request do not break the wheel builders, you may either append         <code class='verbatim'>[wheel build]</code>
 to the end of the commit message of the commit or add one of the following labels to the pull request(if you have the permissions to do so):</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>36 - Build</code>
: for pull requests changing build processes/configurations</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>03 - Maintenance</code>
: for pull requests upgrading dependencies</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>14 - Release</code>
: for pull requests preparing for a release</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>The wheels built via github actions (including 64-bit linux, macOS, and windows, arm64 macOS, and 32-bit windows) will be uploaded as artifacts in zip files. You can access them from the Summary page of the &#34;Wheel builder&#34; <code>:None:None:`Action_`</code>. The aarch64 wheels built via <code>:None:None:`travis_`</code> CI are not available as artifacts. Additionally, the wheels will be uploaded to https://anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly/ on the following conditions:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>by a weekly cron job or</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>if the github action or travis build has been manually triggered, which requires appropriate permissions</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>The wheels wil be uploaded to https://anaconda.org/multibuild-wheels-staging/ if the build was triggered by a tag to the repo that begins with         <code class='verbatim'>v</code>
</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _Action: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>

           </pre>


<h1>Get the mailing list&#39;s opinion</h1>
               <p>If you plan a new feature or API change, it&#39;s wisest to first email the NumPy <a link href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion" class='external'>mailing list</a> asking for comment. If you haven&#39;t heard back in a week, it&#39;s OK to ping the list again.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _asking-for-merging:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Asking for your changes to be merged with the main repo</h1>
               <p>When you feel your work is finished, you can create a pull request (PR). Github has a nice help page that outlines the process for <code>:None:None:`filing pull requests`</code>.</p>

               <p>If your changes involve modifications to the API or addition/modification of a function, add a release note to the         <code class='verbatim'>doc/release/upcoming_changes/</code>
 directory, following the instructions and format in the         <code class='verbatim'>doc/release/upcoming_changes/README.rst</code>
 file.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _workflow_PR_timeline:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Getting your PR reviewed</h1>
               <p>We review pull requests as soon as we can, typically within a week. If you get no review comments within two weeks, feel free to ask for feedback by adding a comment on your PR (this will notify maintainers).</p>

               <p>If your PR is large or complicated, asking for input on the numpy-discussion mailing list may also be useful.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _rebasing-on-main:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h1>Rebasing on main</h1>
               <p>This updates your feature branch with changes from the upstream <code>:None:None:`NumPy
github`</code> repo. If you do not absolutely need to do this, try to avoid doing it, except perhaps when you are finished. The first step will be to update the remote repository with new commits from upstream::     </p>

               <pre>git fetch upstream</pre>
               <p>Next, you need to update the feature branch::     </p>

               <pre># go to the feature branch
git checkout my-new-feature
# make a backup in case you mess up
git branch tmp my-new-feature
# rebase on upstream main branch
git rebase upstream/main</pre>
               <p>If you have made changes to files that have changed also upstream, this may generate merge conflicts that you need to resolve. See         <code class='verbatim'>below&lt;recovering-from-mess-up&gt;</code>
 for help in this case.</p>

               <p>Finally, remove the backup branch upon a successful rebase::     </p>

               <pre>git branch -D tmp</pre>
                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>Rebasing on main is preferred over merging upstream back to your branch. Using         <code class='verbatim'>git merge</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>git pull</code>
 is discouraged when working on feature branches.</p>

<h1>Recovering from mess-ups</h1>
               <p>Sometimes, you mess up merges or rebases. Luckily, in Git it is relatively straightforward to recover from such mistakes.</p>

               <p>If you mess up during a rebase::     </p>

               <pre>git rebase --abort</pre>
               <p>If you notice you messed up after the rebase::     </p>

               <pre># reset branch back to the saved point
git reset --hard tmp</pre>
               <p>If you forgot to make a backup branch::     </p>

               <pre># look at the reflog of the branch
git reflog show my-feature-branch

8630830 my-feature-branch@{0}: commit: BUG: io: close file handles immediately
278dd2a my-feature-branch@{1}: rebase finished: refs/heads/my-feature-branch onto 11ee694744f2552d
26aa21a my-feature-branch@{2}: commit: BUG: lib: make seek_gzip_factory not leak gzip obj
...

# reset the branch to where it was before the botched rebase
git reset --hard my-feature-branch@{2}</pre>
               <p>If you didn&#39;t actually mess up but there are merge conflicts, you need to resolve those.  This can be one of the trickier things to get right.  For a good description of how to do this, see <code>:None:None:`this article on merging conflicts`</code>.</p>

<h1>Rewriting commit history</h1>
                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>Do this only for your own feature branches.</p>

</div>


               <p>There&#39;s an embarrassing typo in a commit you made? Or perhaps you made several false starts you would like the posterity not to see.</p>

               <p>This can be done via <em>interactive rebasing</em>.</p>

               <p>Suppose that the commit history looks like this::      </p>

               <pre>git log --oneline
eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs
a815645 Modify it so that it works
2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
13d7934 First implementation
6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant
29001ed Add pre-nep for a couple of structured_array_extensions.
...</pre>
               <p>and         <code class='verbatim'>6ad92e5</code>
 is the last commit in the         <code class='verbatim'>main</code>
 branch. Suppose we want to make the following changes:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Rewrite the commit message for         <code class='verbatim'>13d7934</code>
 to something more sensible.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Combine the commits         <code class='verbatim'>2dec1ac</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>a815645</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>eadc391</code>
 into a single one.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>We do as follows::      </p>

               <pre># make a backup of the current state
git branch tmp HEAD
# interactive rebase
git rebase -i 6ad92e5</pre>
               <p>This will open an editor with the following text in it::      </p>

               <pre>pick 13d7934 First implementation
pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
pick a815645 Modify it so that it works
pick eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs

# Rebase 6ad92e5..eadc391 onto 6ad92e5
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like &#34;squash&#34;, but discard this commit&#39;s log message
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#</pre>
               <p>To achieve what we want, we will make the following changes to it::      </p>

               <pre>r 13d7934 First implementation
pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
f a815645 Modify it so that it works
f eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs</pre>
               <p>This means that (i) we want to edit the commit message for         <code class='verbatim'>13d7934</code>
, and (ii) collapse the last three commits into one. Now we save and quit the editor.</p>

               <p>Git will then immediately bring up an editor for editing the commit message. After revising it, we get the output::      </p>

<h1>Deleting a branch on github_</h1>
               <pre>git checkout main
# delete branch locally
git branch -D my-unwanted-branch
# delete branch on github
git push origin --delete my-unwanted-branch</pre>
               <p>See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely</p>


<h1>Several people sharing a single repository</h1>
               <p>If you want to work on some stuff with other people, where you are all committing into the same repository, or even the same branch, then just share it via <code>:None:None:`github_`</code>.</p>

               <p>First fork NumPy into your account, as from         <code class='verbatim'>forking</code>
.</p>

               <p>Then, go to your forked repository github page, say         <code class='verbatim'>https://github.com/your-user-name/numpy</code>
</p>

               <p>Click on the &#39;Admin&#39; button, and add anyone else to the repo as a collaborator:</p>

                           <pre>.. image:: pull_button.png
</pre>

               <p>Now all those people can do::      </p>

               <pre>git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/numpy.git</pre>
               <p>Remember that links starting with         <code class='verbatim'>git@</code>
 use the ssh protocol and are read-write; links starting with         <code class='verbatim'>git://</code>
 are read-only.</p>

               <p>Your collaborators can then commit directly into that repo with the usual::       </p>

               <pre>git commit -am &#39;ENH - much better code&#39;
git push origin my-feature-branch # pushes directly into your repo</pre>

<h1>Exploring your repository</h1>
               <p>To see a graphical representation of the repository branches and commits::     </p>

               <pre>gitk --all</pre>
               <p>To see a linear list of commits for this branch::     </p>

               <pre>git log</pre>
               <p>You can also look at the <code>:None:None:`network graph visualizer`</code> for your <code>:None:None:`github_`</code> repo.</p>


<h1>Backporting</h1>
               <p>Backporting is the process of copying new feature/fixes committed in <code>:None:None:`numpy/main`</code> back to stable release branches. To do this you make a branch off the branch you are backporting to, cherry pick the commits you want from         <code class='verbatim'>numpy/main</code>
, and then submit a pull request for the branch containing the backport.</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>First, you need to make the branch you will work on. This needs to be    based on the older version of NumPy (not main)::      </p>

               <pre># Make a new branch based on numpy/maintenance/1.8.x,
# backport-3324 is our new name for the branch.
git checkout -b backport-3324 upstream/maintenance/1.8.x</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>Now you need to apply the changes from main to this branch using    <code>:None:None:`git cherry-pick`</code>      </p>

               <pre># Update remote
git fetch upstream
# Check the commit log for commits to cherry pick
git log upstream/main
# This pull request included commits aa7a047 to c098283 (inclusive)
# so you use the .. syntax (for a range of commits), the ^ makes the
# range inclusive.
git cherry-pick aa7a047^..c098283
...
# Fix any conflicts, then if needed:
git cherry-pick --continue</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>You might run into some conflicts cherry picking here. These are    resolved the same way as merge/rebase conflicts. Except here you can    use <code>:None:None:`git blame`</code> to see the difference between main and the    backported branch to make sure nothing gets screwed up.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Push the new branch to your Github repository::      </p>

               <pre>git push -u origin backport-3324</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>Finally make a pull request using Github. Make sure it is against the    maintenance branch and not main, Github will usually suggest you    make the pull request against main.</p>

</li>
            </ol>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>

<h1>Pushing changes to the main repo</h1>
               <p><em>Requires commit rights to the main NumPy repo.</em></p>

               <p>When you have a set of &#34;ready&#34; changes in a feature branch ready for NumPy&#39;s         <code class='verbatim'>main</code>
 or         <code class='verbatim'>maintenance</code>
 branches, you can push them to         <code class='verbatim'>upstream</code>
 as follows:</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>First, merge or rebase on the target branch.</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>Only a few, unrelated commits then prefer rebasing::          </p>

               <pre>git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main</pre>
               <p>See         <code class='verbatim'>rebasing-on-main</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>If all of the commits are related, create a merge commit::          </p>

               <pre>git fetch upstream
git merge --no-ff upstream/main</pre>
</li>
            </ol>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Check that what you are going to push looks sensible::          </p>

               <pre>git log -p upstream/main..
git log --oneline --graph</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>Push to upstream::          </p>

               <pre>git push upstream my-feature-branch:main</pre>
</li>
            </ol>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>It&#39;s usually a good idea to use the         <code class='verbatim'>-n</code>
 flag to         <code class='verbatim'>git push</code>
 to check first that you&#39;re about to push the changes you want to the place you want.</p>

<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>
