<h1>Broadcasting</h1>
               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. seealso:: 
    :class:`numpy.broadcast`</pre>


               <p>The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is &#34;broadcast&#34; across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.</p>

               <p>NumPy operations are usually done on pairs of arrays on an element-by-element basis.  In the simplest case, the two arrays must have exactly the same shape, as in the following example:</p>

                           <blockquote><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = np.array([2.0, 2.0, 2.0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a * b
array([2.,  4.,  6.])</pre></blockquote>

               <p>NumPy&#39;s broadcasting rule relaxes this constraint when the arrays&#39; shapes meet certain constraints. The simplest broadcasting example occurs when an array and a scalar value are combined in an operation:</p>

               <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; a * b
array([2.,  4.,  6.])</pre>
               <p>The result is equivalent to the previous example where         <code class='verbatim'>b</code>
 was an array. We can think of the scalar         <code class='verbatim'>b</code>
 being <em>stretched</em> during the arithmetic operation into an array with the same shape as         <code class='verbatim'>a</code>
. The new elements in         <code class='verbatim'>b</code>
, as shown in         <code class='verbatim'>broadcasting.figure-1</code>
, are simply copies of the original scalar. The stretching analogy is only conceptual.  NumPy is smart enough to use the original scalar value without actually making copies so that broadcasting operations are as memory and computationally efficient as possible.</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. figure:: broadcasting_1.png
    [&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;A scalar is broadcast to match the shape of the 1-d array it\n          is being multiplied to.&#39;]
    [&#39;name&#39;, &#39;broadcasting.figure-1&#39;]
    *Figure 1*

    *In the simplest example of broadcasting, the scalar* ``b`` *is
    stretched to become an array of same shape as* ``a`` *so the shapes
    are compatible for element-by-element multiplication.*</pre>


               <p>The code in the second example is more efficient than that in the first because broadcasting moves less memory around during the multiplication (        <code class='verbatim'>b</code>
 is a scalar rather than an array).</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _general-broadcasting-rules:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>General Broadcasting Rules</h2>
               <p>When operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing (i.e. rightmost) dimensions and works its way left.  Two dimensions are compatible when</p>

                          <ol>               <li>               <p>they are equal, or</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>one of them is 1</p>

</li>
            </ol>

               <p>If these conditions are not met, a         <code class='verbatim'>ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together</code>
 exception is thrown, indicating that the arrays have incompatible shapes. The size of the resulting array is the size that is not 1 along each axis of the inputs.</p>

               <p>Arrays do not need to have the same <em>number</em> of dimensions.  For example, if you have a         <code class='verbatim'>256x256x3</code>
 array of RGB values, and you want to scale each color in the image by a different value, you can multiply the image by a one-dimensional array with 3 values. Lining up the sizes of the trailing axes of these arrays according to the broadcast rules, shows that they are compatible:    </p>

               <pre>Image  (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3
Scale  (1d array):             3
Result (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3</pre>
               <p>When either of the dimensions compared is one, the other is used.  In other words, dimensions with size 1 are stretched or &#34;copied&#34; to match the other.</p>

               <p>In the following example, both the         <code class='verbatim'>A</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>B</code>
 arrays have axes with length one that are expanded to a larger size during the broadcast operation:    </p>

               <pre>A      (4d array):  8 x 1 x 6 x 1
B      (3d array):      7 x 1 x 5
Result (4d array):  8 x 7 x 6 x 5</pre>
                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _arrays.broadcasting.broadcastable:&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h2>Broadcastable arrays</h2>
               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. index:: broadcastable
    </pre>


               <p>A set of arrays is called &#34;broadcastable&#34; to the same shape if the above rules produce a valid result.</p>

               <p>For example, if         <code class='verbatim'>a.shape</code>
 is (5,1),         <code class='verbatim'>b.shape</code>
 is (1,6),         <code class='verbatim'>c.shape</code>
 is (6,) and         <code class='verbatim'>d.shape</code>
 is () so that <em>d</em> is a scalar, then <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are all broadcastable to dimension (5,6); and</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p><em>a</em> acts like a (5,6) array where         <code class='verbatim'>a[:,0]</code>
 is broadcast to the other   columns,</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><em>b</em> acts like a (5,6) array where         <code class='verbatim'>b[0,:]</code>
 is broadcast   to the other rows,</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><em>c</em> acts like a (1,6) array and therefore like a (5,6) array   where         <code class='verbatim'>c[:]</code>
 is broadcast to every row, and finally,</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><em>d</em> acts like a (5,6) array where the single value is repeated.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>Here are some more examples:    </p>

               <pre>A      (2d array):  5 x 4
B      (1d array):      1
Result (2d array):  5 x 4

A      (2d array):  5 x 4
B      (1d array):      4
Result (2d array):  5 x 4

A      (3d array):  15 x 3 x 5
B      (3d array):  15 x 1 x 5
Result (3d array):  15 x 3 x 5

A      (3d array):  15 x 3 x 5
B      (2d array):       3 x 5
Result (3d array):  15 x 3 x 5

A      (3d array):  15 x 3 x 5
B      (2d array):       3 x 1
Result (3d array):  15 x 3 x 5</pre>
               <p>Here are examples of shapes that do not broadcast:    </p>

               <pre>A      (1d array):  3
B      (1d array):  4 # trailing dimensions do not match

A      (2d array):      2 x 1
B      (3d array):  8 x 4 x 3 # second from last dimensions mismatched</pre>
               <p>An example of broadcasting when a 1-d array is added to a 2-d array:    </p>

               <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([[ 0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
...               [10.0, 10.0, 10.0],

<h2>A Practical Example: Vector Quantization</h2>
               <p>Broadcasting comes up quite often in real world problems. A typical example occurs in the vector quantization (VQ) algorithm used in information theory, classification, and other related areas. The basic operation in VQ finds the closest point in a set of points, called         <code class='verbatim'>codes</code>
 in VQ jargon, to a given point, called the         <code class='verbatim'>observation</code>
. In the very simple, two-dimensional case shown below, the values in         <code class='verbatim'>observation</code>
 describe the weight and height of an athlete to be classified. The         <code class='verbatim'>codes</code>
 represent different classes of athletes.  Finding the closest point requires calculating the distance between observation and each of the codes. The shortest distance provides the best match. In this example,         <code class='verbatim'>codes[0]</code>
 is the closest class indicating that the athlete is likely a basketball player.</p>

                           <blockquote><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy import array, argmin, sqrt, sum
&gt;&gt;&gt; observation = array([111.0, 188.0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; codes = array([[102.0, 203.0],
...                [132.0, 193.0],
...                [45.0, 155.0],
...                [57.0, 173.0]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; diff = codes - observation    # the broadcast happens here
&gt;&gt;&gt; dist = sqrt(sum(diff**2,axis=-1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; argmin(dist)
0</pre></blockquote>

               <p>In this example, the         <code class='verbatim'>observation</code>
 array is stretched to match the shape of the         <code class='verbatim'>codes</code>
 array:    </p>

               <pre>Observation      (1d array):      2
Codes            (2d array):  4 x 2
Diff             (2d array):  4 x 2</pre>

    *Figure 5*

    *The basic operation of vector quantization calculates the distance between
    an object to be classified, the dark square, and multiple known codes, the
    gray circles. In this simple case, the codes represent individual classes.
    More complex cases use multiple codes per class.*</pre>


               <p>Typically, a large number of         <code class='verbatim'>observations</code>
, perhaps read from a database, are compared to a set of         <code class='verbatim'>codes</code>
. Consider this scenario:    </p>

               <pre>Observation      (2d array):      10 x 3
Codes            (2d array):       5 x 3
Diff             (3d array):  5 x 10 x 3</pre>
               <p>The three-dimensional array,         <code class='verbatim'>diff</code>
, is a consequence of broadcasting, not a necessity for the calculation. Large data sets will generate a large intermediate array that is computationally inefficient. Instead, if each observation is calculated individually using a Python loop around the code in the two-dimensional example above, a much smaller array is used.</p>

               <p>Broadcasting is a powerful tool for writing short and usually intuitive code that does its computations very efficiently in C. However, there are cases when broadcasting uses unnecessarily large amounts of memory for a particular algorithm. In these cases, it is better to write the algorithm&#39;s outer loop in Python. This may also produce more readable code, as algorithms that use broadcasting tend to become more difficult to interpret as the number of dimensions in the broadcast increases.</p>

            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;footnote&#39; &#39;.. [#f1]\n    In this example, weight has more impact on the distance calculation\n    than height because of the larger values. In practice, it is important to\n    normalize the height and weight, often by their standard deviation across the\n    data set, so that both have equal influence on the distance calculation.&#39;&gt;

<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
