<h1>0.10 series</h1>

<h2>Release 0.10.2</h2>
               <p>IPython 0.10.2 was released April 9, 2011.  This is a minor bugfix release that preserves backward compatibility.  At this point, all IPython development resources are focused on the 0.11 series that includes a complete architectural restructuring of the project as well as many new capabilities, so this is likely to be the last release of the 0.10.x series.  We have tried to fix all major bugs in this series so that it remains a viable platform for those not ready yet to transition to the 0.11 and newer codebase (since that will require some porting effort, as a number of APIs have changed).</p>

               <p>Thus, we are not opening a 0.10.3 active development branch yet, but if the user community requires new patches and is willing to maintain/release such a branch, we&#39;ll be happy to host it on the IPython github repositories.</p>

               <p>Highlights of this release:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The main one is the closing of github ticket #185, a major regression we had   in 0.10.1 where pylab mode with GTK (or gthread) was not working correctly,   hence plots were blocking with GTK.  Since this is the default matplotlib   backend on Unix systems, this was a major annoyance for many users.  Many   thanks to Paul Ivanov for helping resolve this issue.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix IOError bug on Windows when used with -gthread.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Work robustly if $HOME is missing from environment.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Better POSIX support in ssh scripts (remove bash-specific idioms).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Improved support for non-ascii characters in log files.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Work correctly in environments where GTK can be imported but not started   (such as a linux text console without X11).</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>For this release we merged 24 commits, contributed by the following people (please let us know if we omitted your name and we&#39;ll gladly fix this in the notes for the future):</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Fernando Perez</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>MinRK</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Paul Ivanov</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Pieter Cristiaan de Groot</p>

            </ul>


<h2>Release 0.10.1</h2>
               <p>IPython 0.10.1 was released October 11, 2010, over a year after version 0.10. This is mostly a bugfix release, since after version 0.10 was released, the development team&#39;s energy has been focused on the 0.11 series.  We have nonetheless tried to backport what fixes we could into 0.10.1, as it remains the stable series that many users have in production systems they rely on.</p>

               <p>Since the 0.11 series changes many APIs in backwards-incompatible ways, we are willing to continue maintaining the 0.10.x series.  We don&#39;t really have time to actively write new code for 0.10.x, but we are happy to accept patches and pull requests on the IPython <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`github site`</code>.  If sufficient contributions are made that improve 0.10.1, we will roll them into future releases.  For this purpose, we will have a branch called 0.10.2 on github, on which you can base your contributions.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _github site: http://github.com/ipython&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

               <p>For this release, we applied approximately 60 commits totaling a diff of over 7000 lines:      </p>

               <pre>(0.10.1)amirbar[dist]&gt; git diff --oneline rel-0.10.. | wc -l
7296</pre>
               <p>Highlights of this release:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The only significant new feature is that IPython&#39;s parallel computing   machinery now supports natively the Sun Grid Engine and LSF schedulers.  This   work was a joint contribution from Justin Riley, Satra Ghosh and Matthieu   Brucher, who put a lot of work into it.  We also improved traceback handling   in remote tasks, as well as providing better control for remote task IDs.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>New IPython Sphinx directive contributed by John Hunter.  You can use this   directive to mark blocks in reStructuredText documents as containing IPython   syntax (including figures) and the will be executed during the build:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. sourcecode:: ipython
    In [2]: plt.figure()  # ensure a fresh figure

      @savefig psimple.png width=4in
      In [3]: plt.plot([1,2,3])
      Out[3]: [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x9b74d8c&gt;]</pre>


</li>
               <li>               <p>Various fixes to the standalone ipython-wx application.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We now ship internally the excellent argparse library, graciously licensed   under BSD terms by Steven Bethard.  Now (2010) that argparse has become part   of Python 2.7 this will be less of an issue, but Steven&#39;s relicensing allowed   us to start updating IPython to using argparse well before Python 2.7.  Many   thanks!</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Robustness improvements so that IPython doesn&#39;t crash if the readline library   is absent (though obviously a lot of functionality that requires readline   will not be available).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Improvements to tab completion in Emacs with Python 2.6.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Logging now supports timestamps (see         <code class='verbatim'>%logstart?</code>
 for full details).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A long-standing and quite annoying bug where parentheses would be added to           <code class='verbatim'>print</code>
 statements, under Python 2.5 and 2.6, was finally fixed.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Improved handling of libreadline on Apple OSX.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix         <code class='verbatim'>reload</code>
 method of IPython demos, which was broken.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fixes for the ipipe/ibrowse system on OSX.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fixes for Zope profile.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix %timeit reporting when the time is longer than 1000s.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Avoid lockups with ? or ?? in SunOS, due to a bug in termios.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The usual assortment of miscellaneous bug fixes and small improvements.</p>

<h2>Release 0.10</h2>
               <p>This release brings months of slow but steady development, and will be the last before a major restructuring and cleanup of IPython&#39;s internals that is already under way.  For this reason, we hope that 0.10 will be a stable and robust release so that while users adapt to some of the API changes that will come with the refactoring that will become IPython 0.11, they can safely use 0.10 in all existing projects with minimal changes (if any).</p>

               <p>IPython 0.10 is now a medium-sized project, with roughly (as reported by David Wheeler&#39;s         <code class='verbatim'>sloccount</code>
 utility) 40750 lines of Python code, and a diff between 0.9.1 and this release that contains almost 28000 lines of code and documentation.  Our documentation, in PDF format, is a 495-page long PDF document (also available in HTML format, both generated from the same sources).</p>

               <p>Many users and developers contributed code, features, bug reports and ideas to this release.  Please do not hesitate in contacting us if we&#39;ve failed to acknowledge your contribution here.  In particular, for this release we have contribution from the following people, a mix of new and regular names (in alphabetical order by first name):</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The manual now includes a full set of auto-generated API documents from the   code sources, using Sphinx and some of our own support code.  We are now   using the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Numpy Documentation Standard`</code>  for all docstrings, and we have   tried to update as many existing ones as possible to this format.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The new         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.Extensions.ipy_pretty</code>
 extension by Robert Kern   provides configurable pretty-printing.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Many improvements to the         <code class='verbatim'>ipython-wx</code>
 standalone WX-based IPython   application by Laurent Dufréchou.  It can optionally run in a thread, and   this can be toggled at runtime (allowing the loading of Matplotlib in a   running session without ill effects).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>IPython includes a copy of Steven Bethard&#39;s <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`argparse_`</code> in the           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.external</code>
 package, so we can use it internally and it is also   available to any IPython user.  By installing it in this manner, we ensure   zero conflicts with any system-wide installation you may already have while   minimizing external dependencies for new users.  In IPython 0.10, We ship   argparse version 1.0.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>An improved and much more robust test suite, that runs groups of tests in   separate subprocesses using either Nose or Twisted&#39;s         <code class='verbatim'>trial</code>
 runner   to ensure proper management of Twisted-using code.  The test suite degrades   gracefully if optional dependencies are not available, so that the           <code class='verbatim'>iptest</code>
 command can be run with only Nose installed and nothing   else.  We also have more and cleaner test decorators to better select tests   depending on runtime conditions, do setup/teardown, etc.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The new ipcluster now has a fully working ssh mode that should work on   Linux, Unix and OS X.  Thanks to Vishal Vatsa for implementing this!</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The wonderful TextMate editor can now be used with %edit on OS X.  Thanks   to Matt Foster for this patch.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The documentation regarding parallel uses of IPython, including MPI and PBS,   has been significantly updated and improved.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The developer guidelines in the documentation have been updated to explain   our workflow using         <code class='verbatim'>bzr</code>
 and Launchpad.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fully refactored         <code class='verbatim'>ipcluster</code>
 command line program for starting   IPython clusters.  This new version is a complete rewrite and 1) is fully   cross platform (we now use Twisted&#39;s process management), 2) has much   improved performance, 3) uses subcommands for different types of clusters, 4)   uses argparse for parsing command line options, 5) has better support for   starting clusters using         <code class='verbatim'>mpirun</code>
, 6) has experimental support for   starting engines using PBS.  It can also reuse FURL files, by appropriately   passing options to its subcommands.  However, this new version of ipcluster   should be considered a technology preview.  We plan on changing the API in   significant ways before it is final.</p>

               <li>               <p>cd completer: show bookmarks if no other completions are available.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>sh profile: easy way to give &#39;title&#39; to prompt: assign to variable   &#39;_prompt_title&#39;. It looks like this:                </p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>%edit: If you do &#39;%edit pasted_block&#39;, pasted_block variable gets updated   with new data (so repeated editing makes sense)</p>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Fix #368719, removed top-level debian/ directory to make the job of Debian   packagers easier.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #291143 by including man pages contributed by Stephan Peijnik from the   Debian project.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #358202, effectively a race condition, by properly synchronizing file   creation at cluster startup time.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`%timeit`</code> now handles correctly functions that take a long time to execute   even the first time, by not repeating them.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #239054, releasing of references after exiting.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #341726, thanks to Alexander Clausen.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #269966.  This long-standing and very difficult bug (which is actually a   problem in Python itself) meant long-running sessions would inevitably grow   in memory size, often with catastrophic consequences if users had large   objects in their scripts.  Now, using <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`%run`</code> repeatedly should not cause any   memory leaks.  Special thanks to John Hunter and Sameer D&#39;Costa for their   help with this bug.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #295371, bug in <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`%history`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Improved support for py2exe.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #270856: IPython hangs with PyGTK</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix #270998: A magic with no docstring breaks the &#39;%magic magic&#39;</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>fix #271684: -c startup commands screw up raw vs. native history</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Numerous bugs on Windows with the new ipcluster have been fixed.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The ipengine and ipcontroller scripts now handle missing furl files   more gracefully by giving better error messages.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>%rehashx: Aliases no longer contain dots. python3.0 binary   will create alias python30. Fixes:   #259716 &#34;commands with dots in them don&#39;t work&#34;</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>%cpaste: %cpaste -r repeats the last pasted block.   The block is assigned to pasted_block even if code   raises exception.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Bug #274067 &#39;The code in get_home_dir is broken for py2exe&#39; was   fixed.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Many other small bug fixes not listed here by number (see the bzr log for   more info).</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Backwards incompatible changes</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipykit`</code> and related files were unmaintained and have been removed.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.genutils.doctest_reload</code>
 does not actually call   <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`reload(doctest)`</code> anymore, as this was causing many problems with the test   suite.  It still resets <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`doctest.master`</code> to None.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>While we have not deliberately broken Python 2.4 compatibility, only minor   testing was done with Python 2.4, while 2.5 and 2.6 were fully tested.  But   if you encounter problems with 2.4, please do report them as bugs.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>ipcluster</code>
 now requires a mode argument; for example to start a   cluster on the local machine with 4 engines, you must now type:      </p>

               <pre>$ ipcluster local -n 4</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>The controller now has a         <code class='verbatim'>-r</code>
 flag that needs to be used if you want to   reuse existing furl files.  Otherwise they are deleted (the default).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Remove ipy_leo.py. You can use         <code class='verbatim'>easy_install ipython-extension</code>
 to   get it.  (done to decouple it from ipython release cycle)</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
