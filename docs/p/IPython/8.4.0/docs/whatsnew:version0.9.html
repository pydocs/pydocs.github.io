<h1>0.9 series</h1>

<h2>Release 0.9.1</h2>
               <p>This release was quickly made to restore compatibility with Python 2.4, which version 0.9 accidentally broke.  No new features were introduced, other than some additional testing support for internal use.</p>


<h2>Release 0.9</h2>

<h3>New features</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>All furl files and security certificates are now put in a read-only   directory named ~/.ipython/security.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A single function         <code class='verbatim'>get_ipython_dir</code>
, in         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.genutils</code>
 that   determines the user&#39;s IPython directory in a robust manner.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Laurent&#39;s WX application has been given a top-level script called   ipython-wx, and it has received numerous fixes. We expect this code to be   architecturally better integrated with Gael&#39;s WX &#39;ipython widget&#39; over the   next few releases.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The Editor synchronization work by Vivian De Smedt has been merged in.  This   code adds a number of new editor hooks to synchronize with editors under   Windows.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A new, still experimental but highly functional, WX shell by Gael Varoquaux.   This work was sponsored by Enthought, and while it&#39;s still very new, it is   based on a more cleanly organized architecture of the various IPython   components. We will continue to develop this over the next few releases as a   model for GUI components that use IPython.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Another GUI frontend, Cocoa based (Cocoa is the OSX native GUI framework),   authored by Barry Wark.  Currently the WX and the Cocoa ones have slightly   different internal organizations, but the whole team is working on finding   what the right abstraction points are for a unified codebase.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>As part of the frontend work, Barry Wark also implemented an experimental   event notification system that various ipython components can use.  In the   next release the implications and use patterns of this system regarding the   various GUI options will be worked out.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>IPython finally has a full test system, that can test docstrings with   IPython-specific functionality.  There are still a few pieces missing for it   to be widely accessible to all users (so they can run the test suite at any   time and report problems), but it now works for the developers.  We are   working hard on continuing to improve it, as this was probably IPython&#39;s   major Achilles heel (the lack of proper test coverage made it effectively   impossible to do large-scale refactoring).  The full test suite can now   be run using the         <code class='verbatim'>iptest</code>
 command line program.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The notion of a task has been completely reworked.  An <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ITask`</code> interface has   been created.  This interface defines the methods that tasks need to   implement.  These methods are now responsible for things like submitting   tasks and processing results.  There are two basic task types:           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.task.StringTask</code>
 (this is the old <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Task`</code> object, but   renamed) and the new         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.task.MapTask</code>
, which is based on   a function.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A new interface,         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.mapper.IMapper</code>
 has been defined to   standardize the idea of a <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`map`</code> method.  This interface has a single <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`map`</code>   method that has the same syntax as the built-in <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`map`</code>.  We have also defined   a <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`mapper`</code> factory interface that creates objects that implement           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.mapper.IMapper</code>
 for different controllers.  Both the   multiengine and task controller now have mapping capabilities.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The parallel function capabilities have been reworks.  The major changes are   that i) there is now an <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`@parallel`</code> magic that creates parallel functions,   ii) the syntax for multiple variable follows that of <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`map`</code>, iii) both the   multiengine and task controller now have a parallel function implementation.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>All of the parallel computing capabilities from <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipython1-dev`</code> have been   merged into IPython proper.  This resulted in the following new subpackages:           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.core</code>
,         <code class='verbatim'>traitlets.config</code>
,           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.tools</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.testing</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>As part of merging in the <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipython1-dev`</code> stuff, the         <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
 script and   friends have been completely refactored.  Now we are checking for   dependencies using the approach that matplotlib uses.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The documentation has been completely reorganized to accept the    documentation from <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipython1-dev`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We have switched to using Foolscap for all of our network protocols in           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel</code>
.  This gives us secure connections that are both   encrypted and authenticated.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We have a brand new <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`COPYING.txt`</code> files that describes the IPython license   and copyright. The biggest change is that we are putting &#34;The IPython   Development Team&#34; as the copyright holder. We give more details about   exactly what this means in this file. All developer should read this and use   the new banner in all IPython source code files.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>sh profile: ./foo runs foo as system command, no need to do !./foo anymore</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>String lists now support         <code class='verbatim'>sort(field, nums = True)</code>
 method (to easily sort   system command output). Try it with         <code class='verbatim'>a = !ls -l ; a.sort(1, nums=1)</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>&#39;%cpaste foo&#39; now assigns the pasted block as string list, instead of string</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The ipcluster script now run by default with no security.  This is done   because the main usage of the script is for starting things on localhost.   Eventually when ipcluster is able to start things on other hosts, we will put   security back.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>&#39;cd --foo&#39; searches directory history for string foo, and jumps to that dir.   Last part of dir name is checked first. If no matches for that are found,   look at the whole path.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The Windows installer has been fixed.  Now all IPython scripts have         <code class='verbatim'>.bat</code>
   versions created.  Also, the Start Menu shortcuts have been updated.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The colors escapes in the multiengine client are now turned off on win32 as   they don&#39;t print correctly.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.scripts.ipengine</code>
 script was exec&#39;ing   mpi_import_statement incorrectly, which was leading the engine to crash when   mpi was enabled.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>A few subpackages had missing         <code class='verbatim'>__init__.py</code>
 files.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The documentation is only created if Sphinx is found.  Previously, the           <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
 script would fail if it was missing.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Greedy         <code class='verbatim'>cd</code>
 completion has been disabled again (it was enabled in 0.8.4) as   it caused problems on certain platforms.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Backwards incompatible changes</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>clusterfile</code>
 options of the         <code class='verbatim'>ipcluster</code>
 command has been   removed as it was not working and it will be replaced soon by something much   more robust.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel</code>
 configuration now properly find the user&#39;s   IPython directory.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>In ipapi, the         <code class='verbatim'>make_user_ns</code>
 function has been replaced with           <code class='verbatim'>make_user_namespaces</code>
, to support dict subclasses in namespace   creation.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.client.Task</code>
 has been renamed           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.client.StringTask</code>
 to make way for new task types.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The keyword argument <code><a href="/p/style/*/api/style.html" class='exists'>style</a></code>
 has been renamed <code><a href="/p/dist/*/api/dist.html" class='exists'>dist</a></code>
 in <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`scatter`</code>, <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`gather`</code>   and <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`map`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Renamed the values that the rename <code><a href="/p/dist/*/api/dist.html" class='exists'>dist</a></code>
 keyword argument can have from   <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`&#39;basic&#39;`</code> to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`&#39;b&#39;`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>IPython has a larger set of dependencies if you want all of its capabilities.   See the         <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
 script for details.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The constructors for         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.client.MultiEngineClient</code>
 and            <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.client.TaskClient</code>
 no longer take the (ip,port) tuple.   Instead they take the filename of a file that contains the FURL for that   client.  If the FURL file is in your IPYTHONDIR, it will be found automatically   and the constructor can be left empty.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The asynchronous clients in         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.kernel.asyncclient</code>
 are now created    using the factory functions         <code class='verbatim'>get_multiengine_client</code>
 and            <code class='verbatim'>get_task_client</code>
.  These return a <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Deferred`</code> to the actual client.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The command line options to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipcontroller`</code> and <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipengine`</code> have changed to   reflect the new Foolscap network protocol and the FURL files.  Please see the   help for these scripts for details.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The configuration files for the kernel have changed because of the Foolscap   stuff.  If you were using custom config files before, you should delete them   and regenerate new ones.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Changes merged in from IPython1</h3>

<h4>New features</h4>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Much improved         <code class='verbatim'>setup.py</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>setupegg.py</code>
 scripts.  Because Twisted and   zope.interface are now easy installable, we can declare them as dependencies   in our setupegg.py script.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>IPython is now compatible with Twisted 2.5.0 and 8.x.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Added a new example of how to use         <code class='verbatim'>ipython1.kernel.asynclient</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Initial draft of a process daemon in         <code class='verbatim'>ipython1.daemon</code>
.  This has not   been merged into IPython and is still in <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipython1-dev`</code>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>TaskController</code>
 now has methods for getting the queue status.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>TaskResult</code>
 objects not have information about how long the task   took to run.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We are attaching additional attributes to exceptions         <code class='verbatim'>(_ipython_*)</code>
 that    we use to carry additional info around.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>New top-level module         <code class='verbatim'>asyncclient</code>
 that has asynchronous versions (that   return deferreds) of the client classes.  This is designed to users who want   to run their own Twisted reactor.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>All the clients in         <code class='verbatim'>client</code>
 are now based on Twisted.  This is done by    running the Twisted reactor in a separate thread and using the           <code class='verbatim'>blockingCallFromThread</code>
 function that is in recent versions of Twisted.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Functions can now be pushed/pulled to/from engines using           <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient.push_function</code>
 and           <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient.pull_function</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Gather/scatter are now implemented in the client to reduce the work load   of the controller and improve performance.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Complete rewrite of the IPython docuementation.  All of the documentation   from the IPython website has been moved into docs/source as restructured   text documents.  PDF and HTML documentation are being generated using    Sphinx.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>New developer oriented documentation: development guidelines and roadmap.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Traditional         <code class='verbatim'>ChangeLog</code>
 has been changed to a more useful         <code class='verbatim'>changes.txt</code>
   file that is organized by release and is meant to provide something more   relevant for users.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>Created a proper         <code class='verbatim'>MANIFEST.in</code>
 file to create source distributions.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fixed a bug in the         <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngine</code>
 interface.  Previously, multi-engine    actions were being collected with a         <code class='verbatim'>DeferredList</code>
 with            <code class='verbatim'>fireononeerrback=1</code>
.  This meant that methods were returning    before all engines had given their results.  This was causing extremely odd    bugs in certain cases. To fix this problem, we have 1) set            <code class='verbatim'>fireononeerrback=0</code>
 to make sure all results (or exceptions) are in    before returning and 2) introduced a         <code class='verbatim'>CompositeError</code>
 exception    that wraps all of the engine exceptions.  This is a huge change as it means    that users will have to catch         <code class='verbatim'>CompositeError</code>
 rather than the actual   exception.</p>

<h4>Backwards incompatible changes</h4>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>All names have been renamed to conform to the lowercase_with_underscore   convention.  This will require users to change references to all names like           <code class='verbatim'>queueStatus</code>
 to         <code class='verbatim'>queue_status</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Previously, methods like         <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient.push</code>
 and           <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient.push</code>
 used         <code class='verbatim'>*args</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>**kwargs</code>
.  This was   becoming a problem as we weren&#39;t able to introduce new keyword arguments into   the API.  Now these methods simple take a dict or sequence.  This has also   allowed us to get rid of the         <code class='verbatim'>*All</code>
 methods like         <code class='verbatim'>pushAll</code>
 and           <code class='verbatim'>pullAll</code>
.  These things are now handled with the         <code class='verbatim'>targets</code>
 keyword   argument that defaults to         <code class='verbatim'>&#39;all&#39;</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient.magicTargets</code>
 has been renamed to           <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient.targets</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>All methods in the MultiEngine interface now accept the optional keyword   argument         <code class='verbatim'>block</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Renamed         <code class='verbatim'>RemoteController</code>
 to         <code class='verbatim'>MultiEngineClient</code>
 and            <code class='verbatim'>TaskController</code>
 to         <code class='verbatim'>TaskClient</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Renamed the top-level module from         <code class='verbatim'>api</code>
 to         <code class='verbatim'>client</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Most methods in the multiengine interface now raise a         <code class='verbatim'>CompositeError</code>
   exception that wraps the user&#39;s exceptions, rather than just raising the raw   user&#39;s exception.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Changed the         <code class='verbatim'>setupNS</code>
 and         <code class='verbatim'>resultNames</code>
 in the         <code class='verbatim'>Task</code>
 class to         <code class='verbatim'>push</code>
    and         <code class='verbatim'>pull</code>
.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
