<h3>Major Notebook improvements: new user interface and more</h3>
               <p>The IPython Notebook, which has proven since its release to be wildly popular, has seen a massive amount of work in this release cycle, leading to a significantly improved user experience as well as many new features.</p>

               <p>The first user-visible change is a reorganization of the user interface; the left panel has been removed and was replaced by a real menu system and a toolbar with icons.  Both the toolbar and the header above the menu can be collapsed to leave an unobstructed working area:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. image:: ../_images/ipy_013_notebook_spectrogram.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;New user interface for Notebook&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_notebook_spectrogram.png&#39;)
    </pre>


               <p>The notebook handles very long outputs much better than before (this was a serious usability issue when running processes that generated massive amounts of output).  Now, in the presence of outputs longer than ~100 lines, the notebook will automatically collapse to a scrollable area and the entire left part of this area controls the display: one click in this area will expand the output region completely, and a double-click will hide it completely.  This figure shows both the scrolled and hidden modes:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. image:: ../_images/ipy_013_notebook_long_out.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;Scrolling and hiding of long output in the notebook.&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_notebook_long_out.png&#39;)
    </pre>


                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>The auto-folding of long outputs is disabled in Firefox due to bugs in its scrolling behavior.  See <code class='not-implemented'>:None:ghpull:`2047`</code> for details.</p>

</div>


               <p>Uploading notebooks to the dashboard is now easier: in addition to drag and drop (which can be finicky sometimes), you can now click on the upload text and use a regular file dialog box to select notebooks to upload. Furthermore, the notebook dashboard now auto-refreshes its contents and offers buttons to shut down any running kernels (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1739" class='external'>#1739</a>):</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. image:: ../_images/ipy_013_dashboard.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;Improved dashboard&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_dashboard.png&#39;)
    </pre>



<h4>Cluster management</h4>
               <p>The notebook dashboard can now also start and stop clusters, thanks to a new tab in the dashboard user interface:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. image:: ../_images/ipy_013_dashboard_cluster.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;Cluster management from the notebook dashboard&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_dashboard_cluster.png&#39;)
    </pre>


               <p>This interface allows, for each profile you have configured, to start and stop a cluster (and optionally override the default number of engines corresponding to that configuration).  While this hides all error reporting, once you have a configuration that you know works smoothly, it is a very convenient interface for controlling your parallel resources.</p>


<h4>New notebook format</h4>
               <p>The notebooks saved now use version 3 of our format, which supports heading levels as well as the concept of &#39;raw&#39; text cells that are not rendered as Markdown.  These will be useful with <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`converters_`</code> we are developing, to pass raw markup (say LaTeX).  That conversion code is still under heavy development and not quite ready for prime time, but we welcome help on this front so that we can merge it for full production use as soon as possible.</p>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _converters: https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

                           <div class='admonition'>
    <div>note</div>
        <p>v3 notebooks can <em>not</em> be read by older versions of IPython, but we provide a <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`simple script`</code> that you can use in case you need to export a v3 notebook to share with a v2 user.</p>

</div>


                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _simple script: https://gist.github.com/1935808&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h4>JavaScript refactoring</h4>
               <p>All the client-side JavaScript has been decoupled to ease reuse of parts of the machinery without having to build a full-blown notebook. This will make it much easier to communicate with an IPython kernel from existing web pages and to integrate single cells into other sites, without loading the full notebook document-like UI. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1711" class='external'>#1711</a>.</p>

               <p>This refactoring also enables the possibility of writing dynamic javascript widgets that are returned from Python code and that present an interactive view to the user, with callbacks in Javascript executing calls to the Kernel.  This will enable many interactive elements to be added by users in notebooks.</p>

               <p>An example of this capability has been provided as a proof of concept in         <code class='verbatim'>examples/widgets</code>
 that lets you directly communicate with one or more parallel engines, acting as a mini-console for parallel debugging and introspection.</p>


<h4>Improved tooltips</h4>
               <p>The object tooltips have gained some new functionality. By pressing tab several times, you can expand them to see more of a docstring, keep them visible as you fill in a function&#39;s parameters, or transfer the information to the pager at the bottom of the screen. For the details, look at the example notebook         <code class='verbatim'>01_notebook_introduction.ipynb</code>
.</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. figure:: ../_images/ipy_013_notebook_tooltip.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;Improved tooltips in the notebook.&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_notebook_tooltip.png&#39;)
    The new notebook tooltips.</pre>



<h3>Other improvements to the Notebook</h3>
               <p>These are some other notable small improvements to the notebook, in addition to many bug fixes and minor changes to add polish and robustness throughout:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The notebook pager (the area at the bottom) is now Resizable by dragging its   divider handle, a feature that had been requested many times by just about   anyone who had used the notebook system.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1705" class='external'>#1705</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>It is now possible to open notebooks directly from the command line; for   example:         <code class='verbatim'>ipython notebook path/</code>
 will automatically set         <code class='verbatim'>path/</code>
 as the   notebook directory, and         <code class='verbatim'>ipython notebook path/foo.ipynb</code>
 will further   start with the         <code class='verbatim'>foo.ipynb</code>
 notebook opened.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1686" class='external'>#1686</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>If a notebook directory is specified with         <code class='verbatim'>--notebook-dir</code>
 (or with the   corresponding configuration flag         <code class='verbatim'>NotebookManager.notebook_dir</code>
), all   kernels start in this directory.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix codemirror clearing of cells with         <code class='verbatim'>Ctrl-Z</code>
; <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1965" class='external'>#1965</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Text (markdown) cells now line wrap correctly in the notebook, making them   much easier to edit <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1330" class='external'>#1330</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>PNG and JPEG figures returned from plots can be interactively resized in the   notebook, by dragging them from their lower left corner. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1832" class='external'>#1832</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Clear         <code class='verbatim'>In []</code>
 prompt numbers on &#34;Clear All Output&#34;.  For more   version-control-friendly         <code class='verbatim'>.ipynb</code>
 files, we now strip all prompt numbers   when doing a &#34;Clear all output&#34;.  This reduces the amount of noise in   commit-to-commit diffs that would otherwise show the (highly variable) prompt   number changes. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1621" class='external'>#1621</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The notebook server now requires <em>two</em> consecutive         <code class='verbatim'>Ctrl-C</code>
 within 5   seconds (or an interactive confirmation) to terminate operation.  This makes   it less likely that you will accidentally kill a long-running server by   typing         <code class='verbatim'>Ctrl-C</code>
 in the wrong terminal.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1609" class='external'>#1609</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Using         <code class='verbatim'>Ctrl-S</code>
 (or         <code class='verbatim'>Cmd-S</code>
 on a Mac) actually saves the notebook rather   than providing the fairly useless browser html save dialog.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1334" class='external'>#1334</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Allow accessing local files from the notebook (in urls), by serving any local   file as the url         <code class='verbatim'>files/&lt;relativepath&gt;</code>
.  This makes it possible to, for   example, embed local images in a notebook.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1211" class='external'>#1211</a>.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Cell magics</h3>
               <p>We have completely refactored the magic system, finally moving the magic objects to standalone, independent objects instead of being the mixin class we&#39;d had since the beginning of IPython (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1732" class='external'>#1732</a>).  Now, a separate base class is provided in         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.core.magic.Magics</code>
 that users can subclass to create their own magics.  Decorators are also provided to create magics from simple functions without the need for object orientation.  Please see the         <code class='verbatim'>magic</code>
 docs for further details.</p>

               <p>All builtin magics now exist in a few subclasses that group together related functionality, and the new         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.core.magics</code>
 package has been created to organize this into smaller files.</p>

               <p>This cleanup was the last major piece of deep refactoring needed from the original 2001 codebase.</p>

               <p>We have also introduced a new type of magic function, prefixed with <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`%%`</code> instead of <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`%`</code>, which operates at the whole-cell level.  A cell magic receives two arguments: the line it is called on (like a line magic) and the body of the cell below it.</p>

               <p>Cell magics are most natural in the notebook, but they also work in the terminal and qt console, with the usual approach of using a blank line to signal cell termination.</p>

               <p>For example, to time the execution of several statements:      </p>

               <pre>%%timeit x = 0   # setup
for i in range(100000):
    x += i**2</pre>
               <p>This is particularly useful to integrate code in another language, and cell magics already exist for shell scripts, Cython, R and Octave. Using         <code class='verbatim'>%%script
/usr/bin/foo</code>
, you can run a cell in any interpreter that accepts code via stdin.</p>

               <p>Another handy cell magic makes it easy to write short text files:         <code class='verbatim'>%%file
~/save/to/here.txt</code>
.</p>

               <p>The following cell magics are now included by default; all those that use special interpreters (Perl, Ruby, bash, etc.) assume you have the requisite interpreter installed:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%!</code>
: run cell body with the underlying OS shell; this is similar to   prefixing every line in the cell with         <code class='verbatim'>!</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%bash</code>
: run cell body under bash.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%capture</code>
: capture the output of the code in the cell (and stderr as   well).  Useful to run codes that produce too much output that you don&#39;t even   want scrolled.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%file</code>
: save cell body as a file.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%perl</code>
: run cell body using Perl.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%prun</code>
: run cell body with profiler (cell extension of         <code class='verbatim'>%prun</code>
).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%python3</code>
: run cell body using Python 3.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%ruby</code>
: run cell body using Ruby.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%script</code>
: run cell body with the script specified in the first line.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%sh</code>
: run cell body using sh.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%sx</code>
: run cell with system shell and capture process output (cell   extension of         <code class='verbatim'>%sx</code>
).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>%%system</code>
: run cell with system shell (        <code class='verbatim'>%%!</code>

).</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>This is what some of the script-related magics look like in action:</p>

<h3>Tab completer improvements</h3>
               <p>Useful tab-completion based on live inspection of objects is one of the most popular features of IPython. To make this process even more user-friendly, the completers of both the Qt console and the Notebook have been reworked.</p>

               <p>The Qt console comes with a new ncurses-like tab completer, activated by default, which lets you cycle through the available completions by pressing tab, or select a completion with the arrow keys (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1851" class='external'>#1851</a>).</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. figure:: ../_images/ipy_013_qtconsole_completer.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;ncurses-like completer, with highlighted selection.&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_qtconsole_completer.png&#39;)
    The new improved Qt console&#39;s ncurses-like completer allows to easily
    navigate thought long list of completions.</pre>


               <p>In the notebook, completions are now sourced both from object introspection and analysis of surrounding code, so limited completions can be offered for variables defined in the current cell, or while the kernel is busy  (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1711" class='external'>#1711</a>).</p>

               <p>We have implemented a new configurable flag to control tab completion on modules that provide the         <code class='verbatim'>__all__</code>
 attribute:    </p>

               <pre>IPCompleter.limit_to__all__= Boolean</pre>
               <p>This instructs the completer to honor         <code class='verbatim'>__all__</code>
 for the completion. Specifically, when completing on         <code class='verbatim'>object.&lt;tab&gt;</code>
, if True: only those names in         <code class='verbatim'>obj.__all__</code>
 will be included.  When False [default]: the         <code class='verbatim'>__all__</code>
 attribute is ignored. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1529" class='external'>#1529</a>.</p>


<h3>Improvements to the Qt console</h3>
               <p>The Qt console continues to receive improvements and refinements, despite the fact that it is by now a fairly mature and robust component.  Lots of small polish has gone into it, here are a few highlights:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>A number of changes were made to the underlying code for easier integration   into other projects such as <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`Spyder_`</code> (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2007" class='external'>#2007</a>, <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2024" class='external'>#2024</a>).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Improved menus with a new Magic menu that is organized by magic groups (this   was made possible by the reorganization of the magic system   internals). <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1782" class='external'>#1782</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Allow for restarting kernels without clearing the qtconsole, while leaving a   visible indication that the kernel has restarted. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1681" class='external'>#1681</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Allow the native display of jpeg images in the qtconsole. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1643" class='external'>#1643</a>.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _spyder: https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib&#39;&gt;
           </pre>


<h3>Parallel</h3>
               <p>The parallel tools have been improved and fine-tuned on multiple fronts.  Now, the creation of an         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.parallel.Client</code>
 object automatically activates a line and cell magic function         <code class='verbatim'>px</code>
 that sends its code to all the engines. Further magics can be easily created with the         <code class='verbatim'>.Client.activate</code>
 method, to conveniently execute code on any subset of engines. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1893" class='external'>#1893</a>.</p>

               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>%%px</code>
 cell magic can also be given an optional targets argument, as well as a         <code class='verbatim'>--out</code>
 argument for storing its output.</p>

               <p>A new magic has also been added,         <code class='verbatim'>%pxconfig</code>
, that lets you configure various defaults of the parallel magics.  As usual, type          <code class='verbatim'>%pxconfig?</code>
 for details.</p>

               <p>The exception reporting in parallel contexts has been improved to be easier to read.  Now, IPython directly reports the remote exceptions without showing any of the internal execution parts:</p>

               <pre class='not-implemented'>
.. image:: ../_images/ipy_013_par_tb.png
    (&#39;width&#39;, &#39;460px&#39;)
    (&#39;alt&#39;, &#39;Improved parallel exceptions.&#39;)
    (&#39;align&#39;, &#39;center&#39;)
    (&#39;target&#39;, &#39;../_images/ipy_013_par_tb.png&#39;)
    </pre>


               <p>The parallel tools now default to using         <code class='verbatim'>NoDB</code>
 as the storage backend for intermediate results.  This means that the default usage case will have a significantly reduced memory footprint, though certain advanced features are not available with this backend.</p>

               <p>The parallel magics now display all output, so you can do parallel plotting or other actions with complex display.  The         <code class='verbatim'>px</code>
 magic has now both line and cell modes, and in cell mode finer control has been added about how to collate output from multiple engines. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1768" class='external'>#1768</a>.</p>

               <p>There have also been incremental improvements to the SSH launchers:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>add to_send/fetch steps for moving connection files around.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>add SSHProxyEngineSetLauncher, for invoking to <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`ipcluster engines`</code> on a   remote host. This can be used to start a set of engines via PBS/SGE/MPI   <em>remotely</em>.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>This makes the SSHLauncher usable on machines without shared filesystems.</p>

               <p>A number of &#39;sugar&#39; methods/properties were added to AsyncResult that are quite useful (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1548" class='external'>#1548</a>) for everday work:</p>

                           <blockquote>           <ul>               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>ar.wall_time</code>
 = received - submitted</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>ar.serial_time</code>
 = sum of serial computation time</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>ar.elapsed</code>
 = time since submission (wall_time if done)</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>ar.progress</code>
 = (int) number of sub-tasks that have completed</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>len(ar)</code>
 = # of tasks</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>ar.wait_interactive()</code>
: prints progress</p>

</li>
            </ul>
</blockquote>

               <p>Added         <code class='verbatim'>.Client.spin_thread</code>
 /         <code class='verbatim'>~.Client.stop_spin_thread</code>
 for running spin in a background thread, to keep zmq queue clear.  This can be used to ensure that timing information is as accurate as possible (at the cost of having a background thread active).</p>

               <p>Set TaskScheduler.hwm default to 1 instead of 0.  1 has more predictable/intuitive behavior, if often slower, and thus a more logical default.  Users whose workloads require maximum throughput and are largely homogeneous in time per task can make the optimization themselves, but now the behavior will be less surprising to new users. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1294" class='external'>#1294</a>.</p>


<h3>Kernel/Engine unification</h3>
               <p>This is mostly work &#39;under the hood&#39;, but it is actually a <em>major</em> achievement for the project that has deep implications in the long term: at last, we have unified the main object that executes as the user&#39;s interactive shell (which we refer to as the <em>IPython kernel</em>) with the objects that run in all the worker nodes of the parallel computing facilities (the <em>IPython engines</em>).  Ever since the first implementation of IPython&#39;s parallel code back in 2006, we had wanted to have these two roles be played by the same machinery, but a number of technical reasons had prevented that from being true.</p>

               <p>In this release we have now merged them, and this has a number of important consequences:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>It is now possible to connect any of our clients (qtconsole or terminal   console) to any individual parallel engine, with the <em>exact</em> behavior of   working at a &#39;regular&#39; IPython console/qtconsole.  This makes debugging,   plotting, etc. in parallel scenarios vastly easier.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Parallel engines can always execute arbitrary &#39;IPython code&#39;, that is, code   that has magics, shell extensions, etc.  In combination with the         <code class='verbatim'>%%px</code>
   magics, it is thus extremely natural for example to send to all engines a   block of Cython or R code to be executed via the new Cython and R magics. For   example, this snippet would send the R block to all active engines in a   cluster:      </p>

               <pre>%%px
%%R
... R code goes here</pre>
</li>
               <li>               <p>It is possible to embed not only an interactive shell with the           <code class='verbatim'>IPython.embed</code>
 call as always, but now you can also embed a <em>kernel</em>   with         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.embed_kernel()</code>
.  Embedding an IPython kernel in an   application is useful when you want to use         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.embed</code>
 but don&#39;t   have a terminal attached on stdin and stdout.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The new         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.parallel.bind_kernel</code>
 allows you to promote Engines to   listening Kernels, and connect QtConsoles to an Engine and debug it   directly.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

               <p>In addition, having a single core object through our entire architecture also makes the project conceptually cleaner, easier to maintain and more robust. This took a lot of work to get in place, but we are thrilled to have this major piece of architecture finally where we&#39;d always wanted it to be.</p>


<h3>Official Public API</h3>
               <p>We have begun organizing our API for easier public use, with an eye towards an official IPython 1.0 release which will firmly maintain this API compatible for its entire lifecycle.  There is now an         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.display</code>
 module that aggregates all display routines, and the         <code class='verbatim'>traitlets.config</code>
 namespace has all public configuration tools.  We will continue improving our public API layout so that users only need to import names one level deeper than the main         <code class='verbatim'>IPython</code>
 package to access all public namespaces.</p>


<h3>IPython notebook file icons</h3>
               <p>The directory         <code class='verbatim'>docs/resources</code>
 in the source distribution contains SVG and PNG versions of our file icons, as well as an         <code class='verbatim'>Info.plist.example</code>
 file with instructions to install them on Mac OSX.  This is a first draft of our icons, and we encourage contributions from users with graphic talent to improve them in the future.</p>


<h3>New top-level `locate` command</h3>
               <p>Add <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`locate`</code> entry points; these would be useful for quickly locating IPython directories and profiles from other (non-Python) applications. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1762" class='external'>#1762</a>.</p>

               <p>Examples:          </p>

               <pre>$&gt; ipython locate
/Users/me/.ipython

$&gt; ipython locate profile foo
/Users/me/.ipython/profile_foo

$&gt; ipython locate profile
/Users/me/.ipython/profile_default

$&gt; ipython locate profile dne
[ProfileLocate] Profile u&#39;dne&#39; not found.</pre>

<h3>Other new features and improvements</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p><strong>%install_ext</strong>: A new magic function to install an IPython extension from   a URL. E.g.         <code class='verbatim'>%install_ext
  https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics/raw/default/physics.py</code>
.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>%loadpy</code>
 magic is no longer restricted to Python files, and has been   renamed         <code class='verbatim'>%load</code>
. The old name remains as an alias.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>New command line arguments will help external programs find IPython folders:           <code class='verbatim'>ipython locate</code>
 finds the user&#39;s IPython directory, and         <code class='verbatim'>ipython locate
  profile foo</code>
 finds the folder for the &#39;foo&#39; profile (if it exists).</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The <code class='not-implemented'>:None:envvar:`IPYTHON_DIR`</code> environment variable, introduced in the Great   Reorganization of 0.11 and existing only in versions 0.11-0.13, has been   deprecated. As described in <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1167" class='external'>#1167</a>, the complexity and confusion of   migrating to this variable is not worth the aesthetic improvement. Please use   the historical <code class='not-implemented'>:None:envvar:`IPYTHONDIR`</code> environment variable instead.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The default value of <em>interactivity</em> passed from           <code class='verbatim'>~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_cell</code>
 to           <code class='verbatim'>~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_ast_nodes</code>
   is now configurable.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>New         <code class='verbatim'>%alias_magic</code>
 function to conveniently create aliases of existing   magics, if you prefer to have shorter names for personal use.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>We ship unminified versions of the JavaScript libraries we use, to better   comply with Debian&#39;s packaging policies.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Simplify the information presented by         <code class='verbatim'>obj?/obj??</code>
 to eliminate a few   redundant fields when possible.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2038" class='external'>#2038</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Improved continuous integration for IPython.  We now have automated test runs   on <a link href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ipython" class='external'>Shining Panda</a> and <a link href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/ipython/ipython" class='external'>Travis-CI</a>, as well as <a link href="http://tox.testrun.org" class='external'>Tox support</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>The <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`vim-ipython`</code> functionality (externally developed) has been updated to   the latest version.</p>

</li>
            </ul>

                          <pre class='not-implemented'>
            &lt;Unimplemented &#39;target&#39; &#39;.. _vim-ipython: https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython&#39;&gt;
           </pre>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>%save</code>
 magic now has a         <code class='verbatim'>-f</code>
 flag to force overwriting, which makes   it much more usable in the notebook where it is not possible to reply to   interactive questions from the kernel. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1937" class='external'>#1937</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Use dvipng to format sympy.Matrix, enabling display of matrices in the Qt   console with the sympy printing extension. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1861" class='external'>#1861</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Our messaging protocol now has a reasonable test suite, helping ensure that   we don&#39;t accidentally deviate from the spec and possibly break third-party   applications that may have been using it.  We encourage users to contribute   more stringent tests to this part of the test suite.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1627" class='external'>#1627</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Use LaTeX to display, on output, various built-in types with the SymPy   printing extension. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1399" class='external'>#1399</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Add Gtk3 event loop integration and example. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1588" class='external'>#1588</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>        <code class='verbatim'>clear_output</code>
 improvements, which allow things like progress bars and other   simple animations to work well in the notebook (<a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1563" class='external'>#1563</a>):</p>

                           <blockquote>           <ul>               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`clear_output()`</code> clears the line, even in terminal IPython, the QtConsole       and plain Python as well, by printing <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`\r`</code> to streams.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`clear_output()`</code> avoids the flicker in the notebook by adding a delay,       and firing immediately upon the next actual display message.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p><code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`display_javascript`</code> hides its <code class='not-implemented'>:None:None:`output_area`</code> element, so using display to       run a bunch of javascript doesn&#39;t result in ever-growing vertical space.</p>

</li>
            </ul>
</blockquote>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Add simple support for running inside a virtualenv.  While this doesn&#39;t   supplant proper installation (as users should do), it helps ad-hoc calling of   IPython from inside a virtualenv. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1388" class='external'>#1388</a>.</p>

            </ul>


<h3>Major Bugs fixed</h3>
               <p>In this cycle, we have         <code class='verbatim'>closed over 740 issues &lt;issues_list_013&gt;</code>
, but a few major ones merit special mention:</p>

                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The         <code class='verbatim'>%pastebin</code>
 magic has been updated to point to gist.github.com, since   unfortunately http://paste.pocoo.org has closed down. We also added a -d flag   for the user to provide a gist description string. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1670" class='external'>#1670</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix         <code class='verbatim'>%paste</code>
 that would reject certain valid inputs. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1258" class='external'>#1258</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix sending and receiving of Numpy structured arrays (those with composite   dtypes, often used as recarrays). <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2034" class='external'>#2034</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Reconnect when the websocket connection closes unexpectedly. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1577" class='external'>#1577</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix truncated representation of objects in the debugger by showing at least   80 characters&#39; worth of information.  <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1793" class='external'>#1793</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix logger to be Unicode-aware: logging could crash ipython if there was   unicode in the input. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1792" class='external'>#1792</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix images missing from XML/SVG export in the Qt console. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1449" class='external'>#1449</a>.</p>

</li>
               <li>               <p>Fix deepreload on Python 3. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1625" class='external'>#1625</a>, as well as having a much cleaner   and more robust implementation of deepreload in general. <a link href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1457" class='external'>#1457</a>.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3>Backwards incompatible changes</h3>
                          <ul>               <li>               <p>The exception         <code class='verbatim'>IPython.core.error.TryNext</code>
 previously accepted   arguments and keyword arguments to be passed to the next implementation   of the hook. This feature was removed as it made error message propagation   difficult and violated the principle of loose coupling.</p>

</li>
            </ul>


<h3 id="section-Examples">Examples</h3>
         See :
    


<h3>Local connectivity graph</h3>
<p>Hover to see nodes names; edges to Self not shown, Caped at 50 nodes.</p>

<p> Using a canvas is more power efficient and can get hundred of nodes ; but does not allow hyperlinks; , arrows
or text (beyond on hover) </p> 
<canvas class='graph' width="800" height="500"></canvas>
<p> SVG is more flexible but power hungry; and does not scale well to 50 + nodes. </p> 

<svg class='graph' width="600" height="500"></svg>

<p>All aboves nodes referred to, (or are referred from) current nodes; Edges from Self to other have been omitted
(or all nodes would be connected to the central node "self" which is not useful). Nodes are colored by the library
they belong to, and scaled with the number of references pointing them</p>
