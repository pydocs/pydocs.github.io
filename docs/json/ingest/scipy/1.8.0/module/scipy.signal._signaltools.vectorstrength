Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xThe vector strength is a measure of phase synchrony, how well the timing of the events is synchronized to a single period of a periodic signal.€Ù¹‚Ù§xuIf multiple periods are used, calculate the vector strength of each. This is called the "resonating vector strength".€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒfeventsm1D array_likeÙ¹‚Ù§x<An array of time points containing the timing of the events.€Ù°ƒfperiodsfloat or array_likeÙ¹‚ƒÙ§xcThe period of the signal that the events should synchronize to.
