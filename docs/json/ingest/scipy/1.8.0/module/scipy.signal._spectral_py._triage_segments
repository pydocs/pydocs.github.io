If instead the window is array_like and nperseg is not specified, then nperseg is set to the length of the window. A ValueError is raised if the user supplies both an array_like window and a value for nperseg but nperseg does not equal the length of the window.€Ù°ƒgnpersegcintÙ¹‚Ù§vLength of each segment€Ù°ƒqinput_length: int`Ù¹‚Ù§xBLength of input signal, i.e. x.shape[-1].
