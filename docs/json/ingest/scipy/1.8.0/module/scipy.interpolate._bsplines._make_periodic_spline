Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚“Ù§x!The original system is formed by Ù¡in + k - 1Ù§x equations where the first Ù¡ek - 1Ù§w of them stand for the Ù¡ek - 1Ù§xê derivatives continuity on the edges while the other equations correspond to an interpolating case (matching all the input points). Due to a special form of knot vector, it can be proved that in the original system the first and last Ù¡akÙ§xa coefficients of a spline function are the same, respectively. It follows from the fact that all Ù¡ek - 1Ù§x« derivatives are equal term by term at ends and that the matrix of the original system of linear equations is non-degenerate. So, we can reduce the number of equations to Ù¡en - 1Ù§h (first Ù¡ek - 1Ù§x} equations could be reduced). Another trick of this implementation is cyclic shift of values of B-splines due to equality of Ù¡akÙ§xq unknown coefficients. With this we can receive matrix of the system with upper right and lower left blocks, and Ù¡akÙ§xL diagonals.  It allows to use Woodbury formula to optimize the computations.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒaxvarray_like, shape (n,)Ù¹‚Ù§jAbscissas.€Ù°ƒayvarray_like, shape (n,)Ù¹‚Ù§jOrdinates.€Ù°ƒakcintÙ¹‚Ù§pB-spline degree.€Ù°ƒatxarray_like, shape (n + 2 * k,).Ù¹‚‡Ù§xKnots taken on a circle, Ù¡akÙ§q on the left and Ù¡akÙ§x on the right of the vector Ù¡axÙ§a.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒabx:a BSpline object of the degree ``k`` and with knots ``t``.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xWCompute the (coefficients of) interpolating B-spline with periodic boundary conditions.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö„gSummaryjParametersgReturnseNotesx/scipy/interpolate/_bsplines.pyír<class 'function'>x@scipy.signal._ltisys.interpolate._bsplines._make_periodic_splineÙ¯‚€ö€e1.8.0Ù«x'_make_periodic_spline(x, y, t, k, axis)öx1scipy.interpolate._bsplines._make_periodic_spline€
