The original problem is declared infeasible otherwise.€Ù¹‚Ù§xæMuch of the complexity below is to improve efficiency by using singleton columns in the original problem where possible, thus generating artificial variables only as necessary, and using an initial 'guess' basic feasible solution.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x®Modifies original problem to create an auxiliary problem with a trivial initial basic feasible solution and an objective that minimizes infeasibility in the original problem.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx/scipy/optimize/_linprog_rs.pyˆr<class 'function'>xLscipy.signal._filter_design.optimize._linprog_rs._generate_auxiliary_problemÙ¯‚€ö€e1.8.0Ù«x*_generate_auxiliary_problem(A, b, x0, tol)öx6scipy.optimize._linprog_rs._generate_auxiliary_problem€
