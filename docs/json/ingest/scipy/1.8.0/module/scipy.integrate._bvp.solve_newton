Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§yThis is a simple Newton method with a backtracking line search. As advised in , an affine-invariant criterion function F = ||J^-1 r||^2 is used, where J is the Jacobian matrix at the current iteration and r is the vector or collocation residuals (values of the system lhs).€Ù¹‚Ù§xXThe method alters between full Newton iterations and the fixed-Jacobian iterations based€Ù¹‚Ù§x®There are other tricks proposed in , but they are not used as they don't seem to improve anything significantly, and even break the convergence on some test problems I tried.€Ù¹‚Ù§xJAll important parameters of the algorithm are defined inside the function.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‹Ù°ƒancintÙ¹‚Ù§x&Number of equations in the ODE system.€Ù°ƒamcintÙ¹‚Ù§xNumber of nodes in the mesh.€Ù°ƒahundarray, shape (m-1,)Ù¹‚Ù§oMesh intervals.€Ù°ƒgcol_funhcallableÙ¹‚Ù§x)Function computing collocation residuals.€Ù°ƒbbchcallableÙ¹‚Ù§x0Function computing boundary condition residuals.€Ù°ƒcjachcallableÙ¹‚Ù§x’Function computing the Jacobian of the whole system (including collocation and boundary condition residuals).
