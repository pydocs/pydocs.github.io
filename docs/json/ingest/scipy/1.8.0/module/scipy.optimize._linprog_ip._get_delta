This is typically set True when the original Ù¡dA_ubÙ§e and Ù¡dA_eqÙ§s arrays are sparse.€Ù°ƒelstsqdboolÙ¹‚Ù§x®True if the system is ill-conditioned and/or (nearly) singular and thus a more robust least-squares solver is desired. This is sometimes needed as the solution is approached.€Ù°ƒgsym_posdboolÙ¹‚Ù§x×True if the system matrix is symmetric positive definite Sometimes this needs to be set false as the solution is approached, even when the system should be symmetric positive definite, due to numerical difficulties.€Ù°ƒhcholeskydboolÙ¹‚Ù§x¬True if the system is to be solved by Cholesky, rather than LU, decomposition. This is typically faster unless the problem is very small or prone to numerical difficulties.€Ù°ƒbpcdboolÙ¹‚Ù§yATrue if the predictor-corrector method of Mehrota is to be used. This is almost always (if not always) beneficial. Even though it requires the solution of an additional linear system, the factorization is typically (implicitly) reused so solution is efficient, and the number of algorithm iterations is typically reduced.€Ù°ƒbipdboolÙ¹‚Ù§xyTrue if the improved initial point suggestion due to [4] section 4.3 is desired. It's unclear whether this is beneficial.€Ù°ƒjpermc_specxstr (default = 'MMD_AT_PLUS_A')ƒÙ¹‚‡Ù§v(Has effect only with Ù¡msparse = TrueÙ§b, Ù¡mlstsq = FalseÙ§b, Ù¡nsym_pos =
