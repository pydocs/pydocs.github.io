The implementation of sinc involves a scaling factor of pi that distinguishes it from the "mathematician's" version of sinc.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x Stably evaluate exp(a)*sinh(x)/x€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummaryeNotesx!/scipy/sparse/linalg/_matfuncs.pyËr<class 'function'>x^scipy.signal._filter_design.optimize._differentiable_functions.sps.linalg._matfuncs._exp_sinchÙ¯‚€ö€e1.8.0Ù«p_exp_sinch(a, x)öx(scipy.sparse.linalg._matfuncs._exp_sinch€
