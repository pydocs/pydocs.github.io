Prior to SciPy v1.6.0, `cKDTree` had better performance and slightly different functionality but now the two names exist only for backward - compatibility reasons. If compatibility with SciPy < 1.6 is not a concern, prefer `KDTree`. €ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§yTThe algorithm used is described in Maneewongvatana and Mount 1999. The general idea is that the kd-tree is a binary tree, each of whose nodes represents an axis-aligned hyperrectangle. Each node specifies an axis and splits the set of points based on whether their coordinate along that axis is greater than or less than a particular value.€Ù¹‚Ù§xšDuring construction, the axis and splitting point are chosen by the "sliding midpoint" rule, which ensures that the cells do not all become long and thin.€Ù¹‚Ù§xûThe tree can be queried for the r closest neighbors of any given point (optionally returning only those within some maximum distance of the point). It can also be queried, with a substantial gain in efficiency, for the r approximate closest neighbors.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÉFor large dimensions (20 is already large) do not expect this to run significantly faster than brute force. High-dimensional nearest-neighbor queries are a substantial open problem in computer science.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚†Ù°ƒddatawarray_like, shape (n,m)Ù¹‚Ù§y
The n data points of dimension m to be indexed. This array is not copied unless this is necessary to produce a contiguous array of doubles, and so modifying this data will result in bogus results. The data are also copied if the kd-tree is built with copy_data=True.€Ù°ƒhleafsizevpositive int, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xVThe number of points at which the algorithm switches over to brute-force. Default: 16.€Ù°ƒmcompact_nodesnbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x÷If True, the kd-tree is built to shrink the hyperrectangles to the actual data range. This usually gives a more compact tree that is robust against degenerated input data and gives faster queries at the expense of longer build time. Default: True.€Ù°ƒicopy_datanbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xaIf True the data is always copied to protect the kd-tree against data corruption. Default: False.€Ù°ƒmbalanced_treenbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x¿If True, the median is used to split the hyperrectangles instead of the midpoint. This usually gives a more compact tree and faster queries at the expense of longer build time. Default: True.€Ù°ƒgboxsizexarray_like or scalar, optionalÙ¹‚‰Ù§xKApply a m-d toroidal topology to the KDTree..
