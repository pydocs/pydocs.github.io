For each region n, we choose the first triangle (=Voronoi vertex) in self._simplices and a vertex of that triangle not equal to the center n. These determine a unique neighbor of that triangle, which is then chosen as the second triangle. The second triangle will have a unique vertex not equal to the current vertex or the center. This determines a unique neighbor of the second triangle, which is then chosen as the third triangle and so forth. We proceed through all the triangles (=Voronoi vertices) belonging to the generator in points and obtain a sorted version of the vertices of its surrounding region.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`iTypeErrorÙ¹‚Ù§x(If the points are not three-dimensional.€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x?Sort indices of the vertices to be (counter-)clockwise ordered.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€öƒgSummaryfRaiseseNotesx$/scipy/spatial/_spherical_voronoi.pyêr<class 'function'>x\scipy.signal._filter_design.optimize._shgo.spatial.SphericalVoronoi.sort_vertices_of_regionsÙ¯‚€ö€e1.8.0Ù«xsort_vertices_of_regions(self)öxJscipy.spatial._spherical_voronoi.SphericalVoronoi.sort_vertices_of_regions€
