Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚†Ù¹‚Ù§x•Since FORTRAN uses 1-indexing and LAPACK uses different start points for upper and lower formats there are certain offsets in the indices used below.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÖLet's assume a result where the matrix is 6x6 and there are two 2x2 and two 1x1 blocks reported by the routine. To ease the coding efforts, we still populate a 6-sized array and fill zeros as the following ::      €ÙÀxpivots = [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1]Ù¹‚Ù§x3This denotes a diagonal matrix of the form ::      €ÙÀxS[x x        ]
[x x        ]
[    x x    ]
[    x x    ]
[        x  ]
[          x]Ù¹‚Ù§y5In other words, we write 2 when the 2x2 block is first encountered and automatically write 0 to the next entry and skip the next spin of the loop. Thus, a separate counter or array appends to keep track of block sizes are avoided. If needed, zeros can be filtered out later without losing the block structure.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaagndarrayÙ¹‚Ù§x-The permutation array ipiv returned by LAPACK€Ù°ƒelowernbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xRThe switch to select whether upper or lower triangle is chosen in the LAPACK call.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒeswap_gndarrayÙ¹‚Ù§x„The array that defines the row/column swap operations.
