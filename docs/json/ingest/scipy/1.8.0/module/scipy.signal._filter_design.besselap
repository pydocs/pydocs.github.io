This     happens for both low-pass and high-pass filters, so this is the     "phase-matched" case.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xnThe magnitude response asymptotes are the same as a Butterworth     filter of the same order with a cutoff of Ù£ƒbWnööÙ§a.€Ù¹‚Ù§x9This is the default, and matches MATLAB's implementation.€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù¡edelay€Ù¹‚Ù§x£The filter is normalized such that the group delay in the passband     is 1 (e.g., 1 second).
