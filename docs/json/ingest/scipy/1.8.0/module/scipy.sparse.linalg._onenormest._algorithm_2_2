This algorithm 2.2 may be easier to test, so it gives a chance of uncovering bugs related to indexing which could have propagated less noticeably to algorithm 2.4.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒaAx ndarray or other linear operatorÙ¹‚Ù§x3A linear operator that can produce matrix products.€Ù°ƒbATx ndarray or other linear operatorÙ¹‚Ù§sThe transpose of A.€Ù°ƒatmint, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x\A positive parameter controlling the tradeoff between accuracy versus time and memory usage.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaghsequenceÙ¹‚Ù§x÷A non-negative decreasing vector such that g[j] is a lower bound for the 1-norm of the column of A of jth largest 1-norm. The first entry of this vector is therefore a lower bound on the 1-norm of the linear operator A. This sequence has length t.€Ù°ƒcindhsequenceÙ¹‚Ù§xãThe ith entry of ind is the index of the column A whose 1-norm is given by g[i]. This sequence of indices has length t, and its entries are chosen from range(n), possibly with repetition, where n is the order of the operator A.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§vThis is Algorithm 2.2.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö„gSummaryjParametersgReturnseNotesx#/scipy/sparse/linalg/_onenormest.pyÜr<class 'function'>xdscipy.signal._filter_design.optimize._differentiable_functions.sps.linalg._onenormest._algorithm_2_2Ù¯‚€ö€e1.8.0Ù«x_algorithm_2_2(A, AT, t)öx.scipy.sparse.linalg._onenormest._algorithm_2_2€
