Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‹Ù¹‚Ù§x•This class controls our adaptive scaling behavior.  It is intended to be used as a super-class or mixin.  It expects the following state and methods:€Ù¹‚Ù©Ù§eState€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§iplan: set€Ù¹‚Ù§xwA set of workers that we think should exist.     Here and below worker is just a token, often an address or name string€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§nrequested: set€Ù¹‚Ù§x£A set of workers that the cluster class has successfully requested from     the resource manager.  We expect that resource manager to work to make     these exist.€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§mobserved: set€Ù¹‚Ù§xEA set of workers that have successfully checked in with the scheduler€Ù¹‚Ù§xêThese sets are not necessarily equivalent.  Often plan and requested will be very similar (requesting is usually fast) but there may be a large delay between requested and observed (often resource managers don't give us what we want).€Ù¹‚Ù©Ù§iFunctions€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§ftarget€Ù¹‚Ù§ftarget€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§pworkers_to_close€Ù¹‚Ù§pworkers_to_close€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§hscale_up€Ù¹‚Ù§hscale_up€ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§jscale_down€Ù¹‚Ù§jscale_down€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒlminimum: int`Ù¹‚Ù§x%The minimum number of allowed workers€Ù°ƒrmaximum: int | inf`Ù¹‚Ù§x%The maximum number of allowed workers€Ù°ƒowait_count: int`Ù¹‚Ù§xPThe number of scale-down requests we should receive before actually scaling down€Ù°ƒminterval: str`Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xThe amount of time, like Ù¡d"1s"Ù§o between checks€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xIThe core logic for adaptive deployments, with none of the cluster details€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€öƒgSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersx$/distributed/deploy/adaptive_core.pyn<class 'type'>x(distributed.deploy.adaptive.AdaptiveCoreÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«ööx-distributed.deploy.adaptive_core.AdaptiveCore€
