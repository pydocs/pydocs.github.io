Notifies the Scheduler of changes by messaging passing through Queues, which the Scheduler listens to responds accordingly.€Ù¹‚Ù§y:All events are handled quickly, in linear time with respect to their input (which is often of constant size) and generally within a millisecond. Additionally when Cythonized, this can be faster still. To accomplish this the scheduler tracks a lot of state.  Every operation maintains the consistency of this state.€Ù¹‚‰Ù§x%Users typically do not interact with Ù¡kTransitionsÙ§x+ directly. Instead users interact with the Ù¡fClientÙ§x, which in turn engages the Ù¡iSchedulerÙ§xH affecting different transitions here under-the-hood.
