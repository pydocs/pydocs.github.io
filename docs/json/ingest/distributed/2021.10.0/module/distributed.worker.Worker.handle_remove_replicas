Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yThis should not actually happen during ordinary operations and is only intended to correct any erroneous state. An example where this is necessary is if a worker fetches data for a downstream task but that task is released before the data arrives. In this case, the scheduler will notify the worker that it may be holding this unnecessary data, if the worker hasn't released the data itself, already.€Ù¹‚Ù§y=This handler does not guarantee the task nor the data to be actually released but only asks the worker to release the data on a best effort guarantee. This protects from race conditions where the given keys may already have been rescheduled for compute in which case the compute would win and this handler is ignored.€Ù¹‚Ù§x.For stronger guarantees, see handler free_keys€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x\Stream handler notifying the worker that it might be holding unreferenced, superfluous data.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryv/distributed/worker.pyÌr<class 'function'>x)distributed.Worker.handle_remove_replicasÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«x/handle_remove_replicas(self, keys, stimulus_id)öx0distributed.worker.Worker.handle_remove_replicas€
