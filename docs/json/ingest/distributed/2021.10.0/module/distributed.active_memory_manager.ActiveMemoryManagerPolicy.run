If a subset of workers is not provided, it defaults to all workers on the cluster. Either the ActiveMemoryManager or the Worker may later decide to disregard the request, e.g. because it would delete the last copy of a key or because the key is currently needed on that worker.€Ù¹‚Ù§xrYou may optionally retrieve which worker it was decided the key will be replicated to or dropped from, as follows:€Ù¿ƒjcode-blockfpythonÙ¹‚Ù§x+choice = ( yield " replicate " , ts, None) €Ù¹‚‚Ù¡fchoiceÙ§xs is either a WorkerState or None; the latter is returned if the ActiveMemoryManager chose to disregard the request.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x<The current pending (accepted) commands can be inspected on Ù¡tself.manager.pendingÙ§xD; this includes the commands previously yielded by this same method.€Ù¹‚…Ù§x)The current memory usage on each worker, Ù¨Ù§x"downstream of all pending commandsÙ§v, can be inspected on Ù¡xself.manager.workers_memoryÙ§a.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x²This method is invoked by the ActiveMemoryManager every few seconds, or whenever the user invokes scheduler.amm_run_once().
