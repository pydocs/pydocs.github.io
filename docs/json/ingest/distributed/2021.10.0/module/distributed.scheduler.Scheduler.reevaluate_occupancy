Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§yThe expected duration of a task can change over time.  Unfortunately we don't have a good constant-time way to propagate the effects of these changes out to the summaries that they affect, like the total expected runtime of each of the workers, or what tasks are stealable.€Ù¹‚Ù§yfIn this coroutine we walk through all of the workers and re-align their estimates with the current state of tasks.  We do this periodically rather than at every transition, and we only do it if the scheduler process isn't under load (using psutil.Process.cpu_percent()).  This lets us avoid this fringe optimization when we have better things to think about.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x(Periodically reassess task duration time€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx/distributed/scheduler.pyÔr<class 'function'>x*distributed.Scheduler.reevaluate_occupancyÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«x;reevaluate_occupancy(self, worker_index: ctypes.c_long = 0)öx4distributed.scheduler.Scheduler.reevaluate_occupancy€
