Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xïThe scheduler tracks the current state of workers, data, and computations. The scheduler listens for events and responds by controlling workers appropriately.  It continuously tries to use the workers to execute an ever growing dask graph.€Ù¹‚Ù§yAll events are handled quickly, in linear time with respect to their input (which is often of constant size) and generally within a millisecond.  To accomplish this the scheduler tracks a lot of state.  Every operation maintains the consistency of this state.€Ù¹‚Ù§x­The scheduler communicates with the outside world through Comm objects. It maintains a consistent and valid view of the world even when listening to several clients at once.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x1A Scheduler is typically started either with the Ù¡ndask-schedulerÙ§t executable::       €ÙÀx4$ dask-scheduler
