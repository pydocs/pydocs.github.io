This function is applied in parallel to all original chunks of x. See below for function parameters.€Ù°ƒx4combine: callable(x_chunk, axis, keepdims), optional`Ù¹‚Ù§xÊFunction used for intermediate recursive aggregation (see split_every below). If omitted, it defaults to aggregate. If the reduction can be performed in less than 3 steps, it will not be invoked at all.€Ù°ƒx,aggregate: callable(x_chunk, axis, keepdims)`Ù¹‚Ù§x·Last function to be executed when resolving the dask graph, producing the final output. It is always invoked, even when the reduced Array counts a single chunk along the reduced axes.€Ù°ƒx'axis: int or sequence of ints, optional`Ù¹‚Ù§xEAxis or axes to aggregate upon. If omitted, aggregate along all axes.€Ù°ƒxkeepdims: boolean, optional`Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xVWhether the reduction function should preserve the reduced axes, leaving them at size Ù¡koutput_sizeÙ§q, or remove them.€Ù°ƒodtype: np.dtype`Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xKdata type of output. This argument was previously optional, but leaving as Ù¡dNoneÙ§x will now raise an exception.€Ù°ƒx2split_every: int >= 2 or dict(axis: int), optional`‚Ù¹‚Ù§xšDetermines the depth of the recursive aggregation. If set to or more than the number of input chunks, the aggregation will be performed in two steps, one Ù¡echunkÙ§x' function per input chunk and a single Ù¡iaggregateÙ§x@ function at the end. If set to less than that, an intermediate Ù¡gcombineÙ§x( function will be used, so that any one Ù¡gcombineÙ§d or Ù¡iaggregateÙ§x function has no more than Ù¡ksplit_everyÙ§x4 inputs. The depth of the aggregation graph will be Ù¥x2log_{split_every}(input chunks along reduced axes)Ù§xv. Setting to a low value can reduce cache size and network transfers, at the cost of more CPU and a larger dask graph.€Ù¹‚…Ù§xbOmit to let dask heuristically decide a good default. A default can also be set globally with the Ù¡ksplit_everyÙ§h key in Ù¢„kdask.configÙ „ddaski2021.10.0fmodulekdask.configfmoduleõÙ§a.€Ù°ƒsname: str, optional`Ù¹‚Ù§xfPrefix of the keys of the intermediate and output nodes. If omitted it defaults to the function names.€Ù°ƒtout: Array, optional`Ù¹‚Ù§yAnother dask array whose contents will be replaced. Omit to create a new one. Note that, unlike in numpy, this setting gives no performance benefits whatsoever, but can still be useful  if one needs to preserve the references to a previously existing Array.€Ù°ƒxconcatenate: bool, optional`Ù¹‚Ù§x*If True (the default), the outputs of the Ù¡echunkÙ§a/Ù¡gcombineÙ§xN functions are concatenated into a single np.array before being passed to the Ù¡gcombineÙ§a/Ù¡iaggregateÙ§x# functions. If False, the input of Ù¡gcombineÙ§e and Ù¡iaggregateÙ§xé will be either a list of the raw outputs of the previous step or a single output, and the function will have to concatenate it itself. It can be useful to set this to False if the chunk and/or combine steps do not produce np.arrays.€Ù°ƒxoutput_size: int >= 1, optional`Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xSize of the output of the Ù¡iaggregateÙ§x? function along the reduced axes.

For Ù¡echunkÙ§x7 functions, it is one of the original chunks of x. For Ù¡gcombineÙ§e and Ù¡iaggregateÙ§xK functions, it's the concatenation of the outputs produced by the previous Ù¡echunkÙ§d or Ù¡gcombineÙ§x] functions.
