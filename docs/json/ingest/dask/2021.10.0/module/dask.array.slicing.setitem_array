The dasks of these value parts are included in the output dask dictionary, as are the dasks of any 1-d dask array indices. This ensures that the dask array assignment value and any dask array indices are not computed until the Ù¢„qArray.__setitem__Ù „ddaski2021.10.0fmodulex!dask.array.core.Array.__setitem__fmoduleõÙ§w operation is computed.€Ù¹‚Ù§xnThe part of the assignment value applies to block is created as a "getitem" slice of the full asignment value.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒhout_namee`str`Ù¹‚Ù§xThe dask variable output name.€Ù°ƒearrayjdask arrayÙ¹‚Ù§x)The dask array that is being assigned to.€Ù°ƒgindicessnumpy-style indicesÙ¹‚Ù§x6Indices to array defining the elements to be assigned.€Ù°ƒevaluejdask arrayÙ¹‚Ù§xRThe assignment value, i.e. the values which will be assigned to elements of array.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒcdskf`dict`„Ù·„x:A dictionary where the keys are new unique tokens for eachqblock of the form`x-    (out_name, dim_index[, dim_index[, ...]])Ù¹‚Ù§xand the values are either€Ù·f(key,)Ù·“bor`x(    (setitem, key, v_key, block_indices)`x5where key is an existing top-level dask key of array.`x<The first case occurs when the block represented by key doesxnot overlap the indices.`x=The second case occurs when the block represented by key doesx>overlap the indices. setitem is the chunk assignment function;x=v_key is the dask key of the the part of the assignment valuex8that corresponds to the block; and block_indices are thex*assigment indices that apply to the block.`x;The dictionary also includes any additional key/value pairsx5needed to define v_key, as well as any any additionalx;key/value pairs needed to define dask keys contained in thex7block_indices list as references to dask array indices.ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x%Master function for array assignment.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö„gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnsv/dask/array/slicing.pyr<class 'function'>xdask.array.core.setitem_arrayÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«x.setitem_array(out_name, array, indices, value)öx dask.array.slicing.setitem_array€
