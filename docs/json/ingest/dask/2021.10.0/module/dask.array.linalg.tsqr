It requires that the input array have a single column of blocks, each of which fit in memory.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚…Ù¹‚‡Ù§eWith Ù¡akÙ§p blocks of size Ù¡f(m, n)Ù§x/, this algorithm has memory use that scales as Ù¡ik * n * nÙ§a.€Ù¹‚‰Ù§x§The implementation here is the recursive variant due to the ultimate need for one "single core" QR decomposition. In the non-recursive version of the algorithm, given Ù¡akÙ§o blocks, after Ù¡akÙ§a Ù¡em * nÙ§xa QR decompositions, there will be a "single core" QR decomposition that will have to work with a Ù¡j(k * n, n)Ù§h matrix.€Ù¹‚‰Ù§x7Here, recursion is applied as necessary to ensure that Ù¡ek * nÙ§t is not larger than Ù¡amÙ§e (if Ù¡jm / n >= 2Ù§xq). In particular, this is done to ensure that single core computations do not have to work on blocks larger than Ù¡f(m, n)Ù§a.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xqWhere blocks are irregular, the above logic is applied with the "height" of the "tallest" block used in place of Ù¡amÙ§a.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§tConsider use of the Ù¡grechunkÙ§xˆ method to control this behavior. Taller blocks will reduce overall memory use (assuming that many of them still fit in memory at once).€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒkdata: Array`€Ù°ƒqcompute_svd: bool`Ù¹‚Ù§x;Whether to compute the SVD rather than the QR decomposition€Ù°ƒx_max_vchunk_size: Integer`Ù¹‚Ù§xfUsed internally in recursion to set the maximum row dimension of chunks in subsequent recursive calls.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x#Direct Tall-and-Skinny QR algorithm€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö…gSummarypExtended SummaryjParameterseNoteshSee Alsou/dask/array/linalg.py4r<class 'function'>vdask.array.linalg.tsqrÙ¯‚€öƒÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒtdask.array.linalg.qrtdask.array.linalg.qrõÙ¹‚Ù§xPowered by this algorithm€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒvdask.array.linalg.sfqrvdask.array.linalg.sfqrõÙ¹‚Ù§x Variant for short-and-fat arrays€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒudask.array.linalg.svdudask.array.linalg.svdõÙ¹‚Ù§xPowered by this algorithm€öi2021.10.0Ù«x4tsqr(data, compute_svd=False, _max_vchunk_size=None)övdask.array.linalg.tsqr€
