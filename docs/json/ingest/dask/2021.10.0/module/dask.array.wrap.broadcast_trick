Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§x·Dask arrays are currently immutable; thus when we know an array is uniform, we can replace the actual data by a single value and have all elements point to it, thus reducing the size.€ÙÀx=>>> x = np.broadcast_to(1, (100,100,100))

8Ù¹‚Ù§x¶Those array are not only more efficient locally, but dask serialisation is aware of the _real_ size of those array and thus can send them around efficiently and schedule accordingly.€Ù¹‚Ù§x_Note that those array are read-only and numpy will refuse to assign to them, so should be safe.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xIProvide a decorator to wrap common numpy function with a broadcast trick.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summarys/dask/array/wrap.pyˆr<class 'function'>xdask.array.wrap.broadcast_trickÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«ubroadcast_trick(func)öxdask.array.wrap.broadcast_trick€
