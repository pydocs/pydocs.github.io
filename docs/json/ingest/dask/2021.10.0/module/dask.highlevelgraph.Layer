Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xEThis abstract class establish a protocol for high level graph layers.€Ù¹‚Ù§yUThe main motivation of a layer is to represent a collection of tasks symbolically in order to speedup a series of operations significantly. Ideally, a layer should stay in this symbolic state until execution but in practice some operations will force the layer to generate all its internal tasks. We say that the layer has been materialized.€Ù¹‚Ù§x™Most of the default implementations in this class will materialize the layer. It is up to derived classes to implement non-materializing implementations.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§vHigh level graph layer€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryw/dask/highlevelgraph.py-u<class 'abc.ABCMeta'>tdask.blockwise.LayerÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«ööxdask.highlevelgraph.Layer€
