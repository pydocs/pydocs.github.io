Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xQFor operations that have multiple Blockwise operations one after the other, like Ù¡ix.T + 123Ù§x† we can fuse these into a single Blockwise operation.  This happens before any actual tasks are generated, and so can reduce overhead.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x\This finds groups of Blockwise operations that can be safely fused, and then passes them to Ù¡qrewrite_blockwiseÙ§o for rewriting.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒegraphnHighLevelGraph€Ù°ƒdkeyshIterableÙ¹‚Ù§xlThe keys of all outputs of all collections.
