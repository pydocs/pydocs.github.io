If no such factor exists then we just go with the original chunk size and accept an uneven chunk at the end.€Ù¹‚Ù§xZIf c is larger than s then we want the largest multiple of s that is still smaller than c.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xDReturn a chunk dimension that is close to an even multiple or factor€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summarys/dask/array/core.py¶r<class 'function'>xdask.array.core.round_toÙ¯‚€ö€i2021.10.0Ù«nround_to(c, s)öxdask.array.core.round_to€
