Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xÿMost of the seemingly convoluted logic in this completer is an attempt to handle filenames with spaces in them.  And yet it's not quite perfect, because Python's readline doesn't expose all of the GNU readline details needed for this to be done correctly.€Ù¹‚Ù§yFor a filename with a space in it, the printed completions will be only the parts after what's already been typed (instead of the full completions, as is normally done).  I don't think with the current (as of Python 2.3) Python readline it's possible to do better.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x.Match filenames, expanding ~USER type strings.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx&/dev/ipython/IPython/core/completer.pyÎr<class 'function'>x/IPython.core.completer.IPCompleter.file_matchesÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«x*file_matches(self, text: str) -> List[str]öx/IPython.core.completer.IPCompleter.file_matches€
