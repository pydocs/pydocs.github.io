Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yThis class is similar to TermColors, but the escapes are wrapped in  and  so that readline can properly know the length of each line and can wrap lines accordingly.  Use this class for any colored text which needs to be used in input prompts, such as in calls to raw_input().€Ù¹‚Ù§xôThis class defines the escape sequences for all the standard (ANSI?) colors in terminals. Also defines a NoColor escape which is just the null string, suitable for defining 'dummy' color schemes in terminals which get confused by color escapes.€Ù¹‚Ù§x@This class should be used as a mixin for building color schemes.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x)Color escape sequences for input prompts.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx'/dev/ipython/IPython/utils/coloransi.pyJn<class 'type'>x(IPython.utils.PyColorize.InputTermColorsÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«ööx'IPython.utils.coloransi.InputTermColors€
