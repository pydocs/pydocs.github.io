'>' and '+' characters at the beginning of a line are ignored, to allow pasting directly from e-mails, diff files and doctests (the '...' continuation prompt is also stripped).  The executed block is also assigned to variable named 'pasted_block' for later editing with '%edit pasted_block'.€Ù¹‚Ù§x½You can also pass a variable name as an argument, e.g. '%paste foo'. This assigns the pasted block to variable 'foo' as string, without executing it (preceding >>> and + is still stripped).€Ù¹‚Ù§hOptions:€Ù·ƒx7-r: re-executes the block previously entered by cpaste.`xA-q: quiet mode: do not echo the pasted text back to the terminal.Ù¹‚Ù§xCIPython statements (magics, shell escapes) are not supported (yet).€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x:Paste & execute a pre-formatted code block from clipboard.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€öƒgSummarypExtended SummaryhSee Alsox'/dev/ipython/IPython/terminal/magics.py˜r<class 'function'>x6IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalMagics.pasteÙ¯‚€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒfcpastex-IPython.terminal.magics.TerminalMagics.cpasteõÙ¹‚Ù§x9manually paste code into terminal until you mark its end.€öi8.2.0.devÙ«xpaste(self, parameter_s='')öx,IPython.terminal.magics.TerminalMagics.paste€
