For consistency the cursor being on "in between" characters X and Y is equivalent to the cursor being "on" character Y, that is to say the character the cursor is on is considered as being after the cursor.€Ù¹‚Ù§xACombining characters may span more that one position in the text.€ÙÆƒdnote`Ù¹‚Ù§x´If ``IPCompleter.debug`` is : any : `True` will yield a `` - - jedi / ipython - - `` fake Completion token to distinguish completion returned by Jedi and usual IPython completion. €ÙÆƒdnote`Ù¹‚Ù§xÁCompletions are not completely deduplicated yet.
