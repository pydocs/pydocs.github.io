Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚†Ù¹‚Ù§x¿You must terminate the block with '--' (two minus-signs) or Ctrl-D alone on the line. You can also provide your own sentinel with '%paste -s %%' ('%%' is the new sentinel for this operation).€Ù¹‚Ù§ywThe block is dedented prior to execution to enable execution of method definitions. '>' and '+' characters at the beginning of a line are ignored, to allow pasting directly from e-mails, diff files and doctests (the '...' continuation prompt is also stripped).  The executed block is also assigned to variable named 'pasted_block' for later editing with '%edit pasted_block'.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÊYou can also pass a variable name as an argument, e.g. '%cpaste foo'. This assigns the pasted block to variable 'foo' as string, without dedenting or executing it (preceding >>> and + is still stripped)€Ù¹‚Ù§xx'%cpaste -r' re-executes the block previously entered by cpaste. '%cpaste -q' suppresses any additional output messages.€Ù¹‚Ù§x¦Do not be alarmed by garbled output on Windows (it's a readline bug). Just press enter and type -- (and press enter again) and the block will be what was just pasted.€Ù¹‚Ù§x&Shell escapes are not supported (yet).€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x:Paste & execute a pre-formatted code block from clipboard.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö„gSummarypExtended SummaryhSee AlsohExamplesx'/dev/ipython/IPython/terminal/magics.pyWr<class 'function'>x7IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalMagics.cpasteÙ¯‚‚Ù·†oIn [8]: %cpastex3Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop.x:>>> a = ["world!", "Hello"]x:>>> print(" ".join(sorted(a)))c:--lHello world!ÙÁÙÅ‚Ù¹‚Ù§oIn [8]: %cpaste€Ù¹‚‰Ù§xtPasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop.   :>>> %alias_magic t timeit   :>>> %t -n1 pass   :--   Created Ù£ƒb%tööÙ§q as an alias for Ù£ƒg%timeitööÙ§l.
