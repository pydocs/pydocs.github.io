Since the output is _returned_, it will be stored in ipython's regular output cache Out[N] and in the '_N' automatic variables.€Ù¹‚Ù§fNotes:€ÙÇÙ¹‚Ù§x<If an input line begins with '!!', then %sx is automatically€Ù¹‚Ù§xinvoked.  That is, while::    €ÙÀc!lsÙ¹‚Ù§x9causes ipython to simply issue system('ls'), typing::    €ÙÀd!!lsÙ¹‚Ù§x"is a shorthand equivalent to::    €ÙÀf%sx lsÙÇÙ¹‚Ù§xB%sx differs from %sc in that %sx automatically splits into a list,€Ù¹‚Ù§xÎlike '%sc -l'.  The reason for this is to make it as easy as possible to process line-oriented shell output via further python commands. %sc is meant to provide much finer control, but requires more typing.€ÙÀx‡.l (or .list) : value as list.
.n (or .nlstr): value as newline-separated string.
.s (or .spstr): value as whitespace-separated string.Ù¹‚Ù§xRThis is very useful when trying to use such lists as arguments to system commands.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xHShell execute - run shell command and capture output (!! is short-hand).€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx'/dev/ipython/IPython/core/magics/osm.py§r<class 'function'>xIPython.core.magics.OSMagics.sxÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«xsx(self, line='', cell=None)öx#IPython.core.magics.osm.OSMagics.sx€
