Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§y9GUI frameworks like wxPython trap exceptions and call sys.excepthook themselves.  I guess this is a feature that enables them to keep running after exceptions that would otherwise kill their mainloop. This is a bother for IPython which expects to catch all of the program exceptions with a try: except: statement.€Ù¹‚Ù§yóNormally, IPython sets sys.excepthook to a CrashHandler instance, so if any app directly invokes sys.excepthook, it will look to the user like IPython crashed.  In order to work around this, we can disable the CrashHandler and replace it with this excepthook instead, which prints a regular traceback using our InteractiveTB.  In this fashion, apps which call sys.excepthook will generate a regular-looking exception from IPython, and the CrashHandler will only be triggered by real IPython crashes.€Ù¹‚Ù§xbThis hook should be used sparingly, only in places which are not likely to be true IPython errors.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x7One more defense for GUI apps that call sys.excepthook.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx-/dev/ipython/IPython/core/interactiveshell.pyNr<class 'function'>x#IPython.InteractiveShell.excepthookÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«x"excepthook(self, etype, value, tb)öx9IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.excepthook€
