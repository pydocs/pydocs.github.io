Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚…Ù§xComputing jedi's completion Ù¡e.typeÙ§xs can be quite expensive (it is a lazy property) and can require some warm-up, more warm up than just computing the Ù¡dnameÙ§x& of a completion. The warm-up can be :€Ù·…x;- Long warm-up the first time a module is encountered afterx4install/update: actually build parse/inference tree.`xC- first time the module is encountered in a session: load tree fromedisk.Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x^We don't want to block completions for tens of seconds so we give the completer a "budget" of Ù¡h_timeoutÙ§xÈ seconds per invocation to compute completions types, the completions that have not yet been computed will be marked as "unknown" an will have a chance to be computed next round are things get cached.€Ù¹‚Ù§x­Keep in mind that Jedi is not the only thing treating the completion so keep the timeout short-ish as if we take more than 0.3 second we still have lots of processing to do.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚…Ù§x)Core completion module.Same signature as Ù¢„kcompletionsÙ „gIPythoni8.2.0.devfmodulex.IPython.core.completer.IPCompleter.completionsfmoduleõÙ§q, with the extra Ù£ƒgtimeoutööÙ§x parameter (in seconds).€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx&/dev/ipython/IPython/core/completer.py†r<class 'function'>x/IPython.core.completer.IPCompleter._completionsÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«xk_completions(self, full_text: str, offset: int, *, _timeout) -> Iterator[IPython.core.completer.Completion]öx/IPython.core.completer.IPCompleter._completions€
