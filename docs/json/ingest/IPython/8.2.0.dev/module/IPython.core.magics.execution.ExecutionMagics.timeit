This function can be used both as a line and cell magic:€ÙÈÙ¹‚Ù§xpIn line mode you can time a single-line statement (though multiple   ones can be chained with using semicolons).€ÙÈÙ¹‚Ù§xÉIn cell mode, the statement in the first line is used as setup code   (executed but not timed) and the body of the cell is timed.  The cell   body has access to any variables created in the setup code.€Ù¹‚Ù§xŒOptions: -n<N>: execute the given statement <N> times in a loop. If <N> is not provided, <N> is determined so as to get sufficient accuracy.€Ù¹‚Ù§x`-r<R>: number of repeats <R>, each consisting of <N> loops, and take the best result. Default: 7€Ù¹‚Ù§xf-t: use time.time to measure the time, which is the default on Unix. This function measures wall time.€Ù¹‚Ù§xª-c: use time.clock to measure the time, which is the default on Windows and measures wall time. On Unix, resource.getrusage is used instead and returns the CPU user time.€Ù¹‚Ù§xM-p<P>: use a precision of <P> digits to display the timing result.

This is due to the fact that %timeit executes the statement in the namespace of the shell, compared with timeit.py, which uses a single setup statement to import function or create variables. Generally, the bias does not matter as long as results from timeit.py are not mixed with those from %timeit.€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«x/timeit(self, line='', cell=None, local_ns=None)öx4IPython.core.magics.execution.ExecutionMagics.timeit€
