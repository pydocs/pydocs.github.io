Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§xàSpecial syntax should not be transformed when it occurs inside strings or comments. This is hard to reliably avoid with regexes. The solution is to tokenise the code as Python, and recognise the special syntax in the tokens.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xœIPython's special syntax is not valid Python syntax, so tokenising may go wrong after the special syntax starts. These classes therefore find and transform Ù¨Ù§coneÙ§x instance of special syntax at a time into regular Python syntax. After each transformation, tokens are regenerated to find the next piece of special syntax.€Ù¹‚Ù§xXSubclasses need to implement one class method (find) and one regular method (transform).€Ù¹‚Ù§xãThe priority attribute can select which transformation to apply if multiple transformers match in the same place. Lower numbers have higher priority. This allows "%magic?" to be turned into a help call rather than a magic call.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x4Base class for transformations which examine tokens.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx./dev/ipython/IPython/core/inputtransformer2.py»n<class 'type'>x1IPython.core.inputtransformer2.TokenTransformBaseÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«ööx1IPython.core.inputtransformer2.TokenTransformBase€
