If this option is given, the raw input as typed at thexcommand line is used instead.`x>-q: quiet macro definition.  By default, a tag line is printedx@to indicate the macro has been created, and then the contents ofxAthe macro are printed.  If this option is given, then no printoutx&is produced once the macro is created.Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x*This will define a global variable called Ù£ƒdnameööÙ§y+ which is a string made of joining the slices and lines you specify (n1,n2,... numbers above) from your input history into a single string. This variable acts like an automatic function which re-executes those lines as if you had typed them. You just type 'name' at the prompt and the code executes.€Ù¹‚Ù§x@The syntax for indicating input ranges is described in %history.€Ù¹‚Ù§xwNote: as a 'hidden' feature, you can also use traditional python slice notation, where N:M means numbers N through M-1.€Ù¹‚Ù§xCFor example, if your history contains (print using %hist -n )::    €ÙÀxC44: x=1

You can assemble macros with any lines from your input history in any order.€Ù¹‚Ù§x¿The macro is a simple object which holds its value in an attribute, but IPython's display system checks for macros and executes them as code instead of printing them when you type their name.€Ù¹‚Ù§xDYou can view a macro's contents by explicitly printing it with::    €ÙÀpprint macro_nameögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xbDefine a macro for future re-execution.
