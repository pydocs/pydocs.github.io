Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x[This formatter should usually be used as the base class of all formatters. It is a traited Ù£ƒlConfigurableöeclassÙ§x§ class and includes an extensible API for users to determine how their objects are formatted. The following logic is used to find a function to format an given object.€ÙÇ‚Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xFThe object is introspected to see if it has a method with the name    Ù£ƒlprint_methodödattrÙ§xE. If is does, that object is passed to that method    for formatting.€Ù¹‚‡Ù§x`If no print method is found, three internal dictionaries are consulted    to find print method: Ù£ƒrsingleton_printersödattrÙ§b, Ù£ƒmtype_printersödattrÙ§h    and Ù£ƒqdeferred_printersödattrÙ§a.€Ù¹‚…Ù§xíUsers should use these dictionaries to register functions that will be used to compute the format data for their objects (if those objects don't have the special print methods). The easiest way of using these dictionaries is through the Ù£ƒhfor_typeödmethÙ§e and Ù£ƒpfor_type_by_nameödmethÙ§i methods.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x=If no function/callable is found to compute the format data, Ù¡dNoneÙ§x. is returned and this format type is not used.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x,A base formatter class that is configurable.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx'/dev/ipython/IPython/core/formatters.pyx+<class 'traitlets.traitlets.MetaHasTraits'>x%IPython.core.formatters.BaseFormatterÙ¯‚€ö€i8.2.0.devÙ«ööx%IPython.core.formatters.BaseFormatter€
