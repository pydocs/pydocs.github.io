If the int64 values are outside of the range of those perfectly representable as float64 values, a warning is raised.€Ù¹‚Ù§xîbool columns are cast to int8.  uint columns are converted to int of the same size if there is no loss in precision, otherwise are upcast to a larger type.  uint64 is currently not supported since it is concerted to object in a DataFrame.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒddataiDataFrameÙ¹‚Ù§x"The DataFrame to check and convert€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x–Checks the dtypes of the columns of a pandas DataFrame for compatibility with the data types and ranges supported by Stata, and converts if necessary.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€öƒgSummaryjParameterseNotess/pandas/io/stata.py#r<class 'function'>x$pandas.io.stata._cast_to_stata_typesÙ¯‚€ö€e1.4.1Ù«x6_cast_to_stata_types(data: 'DataFrame') -> 'DataFrame'öx$pandas.io.stata._cast_to_stata_types€
