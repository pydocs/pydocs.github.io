If the provided data would cause the stream to overflow, an Ù£ƒgOSErrorööÙ§y8 exception is raised and the data is not written. Once sufficient data has been written to the stream to satisfy the amount specified in the header, the stream is padded to fill a complete FITS block and no more data will be accepted. An attempt to write more data after the stream has been filled will raise an Ù£ƒgOSErrorööÙ§x\ exception. If the dtype of the input data does not match what is expected by the header, a Ù£ƒiTypeErrorööÙ§u exception is raised.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒddatagndarrayÙ¹‚Ù§xData to stream to the file.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒmwritecompletecintÙ¹‚ƒÙ§oFlag that when Ù¡dTrueÙ§xH indicates that all of the required data has been written to the stream.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x#Write the given data to the stream.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö„gSummaryjParametersgReturnseNotesx!/astropy/io/fits/hdu/streaming.pyŒr<class 'function'>x"astropy.io.fits.StreamingHDU.writeÙ¯‚€ö€c5.0Ù«qwrite(self, data)öx0astropy.io.fits.hdu.streaming.StreamingHDU.write€
