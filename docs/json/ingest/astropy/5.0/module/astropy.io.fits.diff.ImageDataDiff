Currently no further comparison is   performed on images that don't have the exact same dimensions.€ÙÈƒÙ¹‚‚Ù¡kdiff_pixelsÙ§y: If the two images contain any different pixels, this   contains a list of 2-tuples of the array index where the difference was   found, and another 2-tuple containing the different values.  For example,   if the pixel at (0, 0) contains different values this would look like::        €ÙÀt[(0, 0), (1.1, 2.2)]Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x`where 1.1 and 2.2 are the values of that pixel in each array.  This   array only contains up to Ù¡mself.numdiffsÙ§x' differences, for storage   efficiency.€ÙÈÙ¹‚„Ù¡jdiff_totalÙ§xM: The total number of different pixels found between the   arrays.  Although Ù¡kdiff_pixelsÙ§x‹ does not necessarily contain all the   different pixel values, this can be used to get a count of the total   number of differences found.€ÙÈÙ¹‚„Ù¡jdiff_ratioÙ§x: Contains the ratio of Ù¡jdiff_totalÙ§x/ to the total number   of pixels in the arrays.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x‹Diff two image data arrays (really any array from a PRIMARY HDU or an IMAGE extension HDU, though the data unit is assumed to be "pixels").€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx/astropy/io/fits/diff.py™n<class 'type'>xastropy.io.fits.ImageDataDiffÙ¯‚€ö€c5.0Ù«ööx"astropy.io.fits.diff.ImageDataDiff€
