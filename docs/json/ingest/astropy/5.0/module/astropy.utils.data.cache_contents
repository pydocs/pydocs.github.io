Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§yŒThis dictionary is a read-only snapshot of the state of the cache when this function was called. If other processes are actively working with the cache, it is possible for them to delete files that are listed in this dictionary. Use with some caution if you are working on a system that is busy with many running astropy processes, although the same issues apply to most functions in this module.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x/Obtain a dict mapping cached URLs to filenames.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryv/astropy/utils/data.pyÌr<class 'function'>x!astropy.utils.data.cache_contentsÙ¯‚€ö€c5.0Ù«x!cache_contents(pkgname='astropy')öx!astropy.utils.data.cache_contents€
