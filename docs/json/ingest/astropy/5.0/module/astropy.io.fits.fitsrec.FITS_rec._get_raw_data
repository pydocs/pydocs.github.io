This may be the immediate .base but is not always.  This is used primarily for variable-length array support which needs to be able to find the heap (the raw data Ù¨Ù§cmayÙ§xC be larger than nbytes + heapsize if it contains a gap or padding).€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§kMay return Ù¡dNoneÙ§xU if no array resembling the "raw data" according to the stated criteria can be found.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x¶Returns the base array of self that "raw data array" that is the array in the format that it was first read from a file before it was sliced or viewed as a different type in any way.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx/astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.pyşr<class 'function'>x&astropy.io.fits.FITS_rec._get_raw_dataÙ¯‚€ö€c5.0Ù«s_get_raw_data(self)öx.astropy.io.fits.fitsrec.FITS_rec._get_raw_data€
