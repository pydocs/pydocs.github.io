Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xÛThe only API method is set_UVC(), which can be used to change the size, orientation, and color of the arrows; their locations are fixed when the class is instantiated.  Possibly this method will be useful in animations.€Ù¹‚Ù§y7Much of the work in this class is done in the draw() method so that as much information as possible is available about the plot.  In subsequent draw() calls, recalculation is limited to things that might have changed, so there should be no performance penalty from putting the calculations in the draw() method.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x&Specialized PolyCollection for arrows.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryu/matplotlib/quiver.pyÃn<class 'type'>xmatplotlib.quiver.QuiverÙ¯‚€ö€e3.5.1Ù«ööxmatplotlib.quiver.Quiver€
