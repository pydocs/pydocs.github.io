Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xôNote that we base the colormapping on the contour levels and layers, not on the actual range of the Z values.  This means we don't have to worry about bad values in Z, and we always have the full dynamic range available for the selected levels.€Ù¹‚Ù§yMThe color is based on the midpoint of the layer, except for extended end layers.  By default, the norm vmin and vmax are the extreme values of the non-extended levels.  Hence, the layer color extremes are not the extreme values of the colormap itself, but approach those values as the number of levels increases.  An advantage of this scheme is that line contours, when added to filled contours, take on colors that are consistent with those of the filled regions; for example, a contour line on the boundary between two regions will have a color intermediate between those of the regions.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x)Color argument processing for contouring.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryv/matplotlib/contour.pyÑr<class 'function'>x-matplotlib.contour.ContourSet._process_colorsÙ¯‚€ö€e3.5.1Ù«u_process_colors(self)öx-matplotlib.contour.ContourSet._process_colors€
