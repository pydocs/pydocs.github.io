Furthermore, the extent of the children will be calculated in the transformed coordinate.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§yDOffset Box with the aux_transform. Its children will be transformed with the aux_transform first then will be offsetted. The absolute coordinate of the aux_transform is meaning as it will be automatically adjust so that the left-lower corner of the bounding box of children will be set to (0, 0) before the offset transform.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx/matplotlib/offsetbox.pyKn<class 'type'>x$matplotlib.offsetbox.AuxTransformBoxÙ¯‚€ö€e3.5.1Ù«ööx$matplotlib.offsetbox.AuxTransformBox€
