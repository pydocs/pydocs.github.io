Masked values, if any, will be converted to NaNs, which are then handled correctly by the Agg PathIterator and other consumers of path data, such as Ù¢„miter_segmentsÙ „jmatplotlibe3.5.1fmodulex"matplotlib.path.Path.iter_segmentsfmoduleõÙ§a.€Ù°ƒecodesxarray-like or None, optionalÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x€N-length array of integers representing the codes of the path.
