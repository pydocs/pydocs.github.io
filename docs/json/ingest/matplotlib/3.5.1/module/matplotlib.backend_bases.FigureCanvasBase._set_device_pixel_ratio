Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§y›Subclasses that support High DPI screens can set this property to indicate that said ratio is different. The canvas itself will be created at the physical size, while the client side will use the logical size. Thus the DPI of the Figure will change to be scaled by this ratio. Implementations that support High DPI screens should use physical pixels for events so that transforms back to Axes space are correct.€Ù¹‚Ù§xMBy default, this is 1, meaning physical and logical pixels are the same size.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒeratioefloatÙ¹‚Ù§x<The ratio of logical to physical pixels used for the canvas.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`dboolÙ¹‚Ù§x™Whether the ratio has changed.
