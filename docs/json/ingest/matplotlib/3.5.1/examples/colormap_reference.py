Colormap reference
==================

Reference for colormaps included with Matplotlib.

A reversed version of each of these colormaps is available by appending
``_r`` to the name, e.g., ``viridis_r``.

See :doc:`/tutorials/colors/colormaps` for an in-depth discussion about
colormaps, including colorblind-friendliness.
