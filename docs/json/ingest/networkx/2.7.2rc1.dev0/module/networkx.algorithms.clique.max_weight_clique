Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚‡Ù§bA Ù¨Ù§fcliqueÙ§xT in a graph is a set of nodes such that every two distinct nodes are adjacent.  The Ù¨Ù§fweightÙ§x8 of a clique is the sum of the weights of its nodes.  A Ù¨Ù§umaximum weight cliqueÙ§x` of graph G is a clique C in G such that no clique in G has weight greater than the weight of C.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§x©The implementation is recursive, and therefore it may run into recursion depth issues if G contains a clique whose number of nodes is close to the recursion depth limit.€Ù¹‚Ù§y!At each search node, the algorithm greedily constructs a weighted independent set cover of part of the graph in order to find a small set of nodes on which to branch.  The algorithm is very similar to the algorithm of Tavares et al. , other than the fact that the NetworkX version does not use bitsets.  This style of algorithm for maximum weight clique (and maximum weight independent set, which is the same problem but on the complement graph) has a decades-long history.  See Algorithm B of Warren and Hicks  and the references in that paper.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graphÙ¹‚Ù§pUndirected graph€Ù°ƒfweightx+string or None, optional (default='weight')Ù¹‚Ù§xgThe node attribute that holds the integer value used as a weight.
