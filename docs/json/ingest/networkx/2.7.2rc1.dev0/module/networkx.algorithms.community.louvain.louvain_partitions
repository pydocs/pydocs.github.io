Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§x¦Louvain Community Detection Algorithm is a simple method to extract the community structure of a network. This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization.€Ù¹‚Ù§ysThe partitions at each level (step of the algorithm) form a dendogram of communities. A dendrogram is a diagram representing a tree and each level represents a partition of the G graph. The top level contains the smallest communities and as you traverse to the bottom of the tree the communities get bigger and the overal modularity increases making the partition better.€Ù¹‚Ù§xaEach level is generated by executing the two phases of the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚…Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graph€Ù°ƒfweightx+string or None, optional (default="weight")Ù¹‚Ù§xsThe name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value used as a weight.
