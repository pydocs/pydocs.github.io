Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xıA right-stochastic graph is a weighted digraph in which for each node, the sum of the weights of all the out-edges of that node is 1. If the graph is already weighted (for example, via a 'weight' edge attribute), the reweighting takes that into account.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒaGndirected graphÙ¹‚…Ù§bA Ù¢„gDiGraphÙ „hnetworkxa*capix networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraphfmoduleõÙ§d or Ù¢„lMultiDiGraphÙ „hnetworkxa*capix*networkx.classes.multidigraph.MultiDiGraphfmoduleõÙ§a.€Ù°ƒdcopyqboolean, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x±If this is True, then this function returns a new graph with the stochastic reweighting.

If no attribute with this key is found for an edge, then the edge weight is assumed to be 1. If an edge has a weight, it must be a positive number.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x<Returns a right-stochastic representation of directed graph Ù¢„aGÙ „ööelocalaGelocalõÙ§a.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€öƒgSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersx!networkx/generators/stochastic.pyr<class 'function'>xnetworkx.stochastic_graphÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«x/stochastic_graph(G, copy=True, weight='weight')öx/networkx.generators.stochastic.stochastic_graph€
