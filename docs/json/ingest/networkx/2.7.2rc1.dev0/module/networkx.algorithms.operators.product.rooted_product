Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§y9A new graph is constructed representing the rooted product of the inputted graphs, G and H, with a root in H. A rooted product duplicates H for each nodes in G with the root of H corresponding to the node in G. Nodes are renamed as the direct product of G and H. The result is a subgraph of the cartesian product.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xiThe nodes of R are the Cartesian Product of the nodes of G and H. The nodes of G and H are not relabeled.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒcG,HegraphÙ¹‚Ù§pA NetworkX graph€Ù°ƒdrootdnodeÙ¹‚Ù§kA node in H€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaRx8The rooted product of G and H with a specified root in H€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x@Return the rooted product of graphs G and H rooted at root in H.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö…gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnseNotesx(networkx/algorithms/operators/product.pyªr<class 'function'>wnetworkx.rooted_productÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«xrooted_product(G, H, root)öx4networkx.algorithms.operators.product.rooted_product€
