Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x©The reciprocity of a directed graph is defined as the ratio of the number of edges pointing in both directions to the total number of edges in the graph. Formally, $r = ÙÉx|{(u,v) \in G|(v,u) \in G}|Ù§t / |{(u,v) \in G}|$.€Ù¹‚Ù§x£The reciprocity of a single node u is defined similarly, it is the ratio of the number of edges in both directions to the total number of edges attached to node u.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x`The reciprocity is not defined for isolated nodes. In such cases this function will return None.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§xA networkx directed graph€Ù°ƒenodesx2container of nodes, optional (default=whole graph)Ù¹‚Ù§x0Compute reciprocity for nodes in this container.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒcoutjdictionaryÙ¹‚Ù§x Reciprocity keyed by node label.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x,Compute the reciprocity in a directed graph.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö…gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnseNotesx"networkx/algorithms/reciprocity.pyr<class 'function'>tnetworkx.reciprocityÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«xreciprocity(G, nodes=None)öx+networkx.algorithms.reciprocity.reciprocity€
