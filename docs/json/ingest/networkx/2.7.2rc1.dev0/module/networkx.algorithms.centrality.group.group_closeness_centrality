Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xzGroup closeness centrality of a group of nodes $S$ is a measure of how close the group is to the other nodes in the graph.€Ù¤xrc_ { close} ( S) = \frac { |V - S|} { \sum_ { v \in V - S} d_ { S, v}} d_ { S, v} = min_ { u \in S} ( d_ { u, v}) Ù¹‚Ù§xwhere $V$ is the set of nodes, $d_{S, v}$ is the distance of the group $S$ from $v$ defined as above. ($V-S$ is the set of nodes in $V$ that are not in $S$).€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚†Ù¹‚Ù§xNThe measure was introduced in . The formula implemented here is described in .€Ù¹‚Ù§x7Higher values of closeness indicate greater centrality.€Ù¹‚Ù§xmIt is assumed that 1 / 0 is 0 (required in the case of directed graphs, or when a shortest path length is 0).€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xBThe number of nodes in the group must be a maximum of n - 1 where Ù£ƒanööÙ§x+ is the total number of nodes in the graph.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xaFor directed graphs, the incoming distance is utilized here. To use the outward distance, act on Ù£ƒkG.reverse()ööÙ§a.€Ù¹‚Ù§xFor weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero. Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length paths between pairs of nodes.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§qA NetworkX graph.€Ù°ƒaSklist or setÙ¹‚Ù§xbS is a group of nodes which belong to G, for which group closeness centrality is to be calculated.€Ù°ƒfweightx'None or string, optional (default=None)Ù¹‚Ù§xÀIf None, all edge weights are considered equal.
