Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§yAThe theorem states that the determinant of any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of a graph is the number of spanning trees in the graph. For a weighted Laplacian matrix, it is the sum across all spanning trees of the multiplicative weight of each tree. That is, the weight of each tree is the product of its edge weights.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX GraphÙ¹‚Ù§x(The graph to use Kirchhoff's theorem on.€Ù°ƒfweightnstring or NoneÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x;The key for the edge attribute holding the edge weight.
