Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§yéA junction tree (or clique tree) is constructed from a (un)directed graph G. The tree is constructed based on a moralized and triangulated version of G. The tree's nodes consist of maximal cliques and sepsets of the revised graph. The sepset of two cliques is the intersection of the nodes of these cliques, e.g. the sepset of (A,B,C) and (A,C,E,F) is (A,C). These nodes are often called "variables" in this literature. The tree is bipartitie with each sepset connected to its two cliques.€Ù¹‚Ù§xiJunction Trees are not unique as the order of clique consideration determines which sepsets are included.€Ù¹‚Ù§x4The junction tree algorithm consists of five steps :€ÙÇ…Ù¹‚Ù§rMoralize the graph€Ù¹‚Ù§uTriangulate the graph€Ù¹‚Ù§tFind maximal cliques€Ù¹‚Ù§xsBuild the tree from cliques, connecting cliques with shared    nodes, set edge-weight to number of shared variables€Ù¹‚Ù§xFind maximum spanning tree€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaGnnetworkx.GraphÙ¹‚Ù§xDirected or undirected graph.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`vNetworkXNotImplementedÙ¹‚‡Ù§jRaised if Ù¢„aGÙ „ööelocalaGelocalõÙ§s is an instance of Ù¢„jMultiGraphÙ „hnetworkxm2.7.2rc1.dev0fmodulex&networkx.classes.multigraph.MultiGraphfmoduleõÙ§d or Ù¢„lMultiDiGraphÙ „hnetworkxm2.7.2rc1.dev0fmodulex*networkx.classes.multidigraph.MultiDiGraphfmoduleõÙ§a.€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒmjunction_treennetworkx.GraphÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x#The corresponding junction tree of Ù¢„aGÙ „ööelocalaGelocalõÙ§a.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x)Returns a junction tree of a given graph.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö†gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnsfRaisesjReferencesx)networkx/algorithms/tree/decomposition.pyr<class 'function'>vnetworkx.junction_treeÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«pjunction_tree(G)öx4networkx.algorithms.tree.decomposition.junction_tree€
