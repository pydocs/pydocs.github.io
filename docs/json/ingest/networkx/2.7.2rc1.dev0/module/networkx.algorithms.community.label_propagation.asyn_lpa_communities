Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§x™The asynchronous label propagation algorithm is described in . The algorithm is probabilistic and the found communities may vary on different executions.€Ù¹‚Ù§y¡The algorithm proceeds as follows. After initializing each node with a unique label, the algorithm repeatedly sets the label of a node to be the label that appears most frequently among that nodes neighbors. The algorithm halts when each node has the label that appears most frequently among its neighbors. The algorithm is asynchronous because each node is updated without waiting for updates on the remaining nodes.€Ù¹‚Ù§xCThis generalized version of the algorithm in  accepts edge weights.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x)Edge weight attributes must be numerical.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒaGeGraph€Ù°ƒfweightfstringÙ¹‚Ù§y$The edge attribute representing the weight of an edge. If None, each edge is assumed to have weight one. In this algorithm, the weight of an edge is used in determining the frequency with which a label appears among the neighbors of a node: a higher weight means the label appears more often.€Ù°ƒdseedx(integer, random_state, or None (default)Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x1Indicator of random number generation state.
