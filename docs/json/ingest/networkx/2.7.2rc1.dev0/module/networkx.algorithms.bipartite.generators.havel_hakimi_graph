Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§y,The graph is composed of two partitions. Set A has nodes 0 to (len(aseq) - 1) and set B has nodes len(aseq) to (len(bseq) - 1). Nodes from the set A are connected to nodes in the set B by connecting the highest degree nodes in set A to the highest degree nodes in set B until all stubs are connected.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yThe sum of the two sequences must be equal: sum(aseq)=sum(bseq) If no graph type is specified use MultiGraph with parallel edges. If you want a graph with no parallel edges use create_using=Graph() but then the resulting degree sequences might not be exact.€Ù¹‚Ù§x{The nodes are assigned the attribute 'bipartite' with the value 0 or 1 to indicate which bipartite set the node belongs to.€Ù¹‚Ù§xbThis function is not imported in the main namespace.
