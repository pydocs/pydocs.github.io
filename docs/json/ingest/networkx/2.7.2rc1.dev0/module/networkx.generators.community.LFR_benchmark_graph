Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§x#This algorithm proceeds as follows:€ÙÇ†Ù¹‚…Ù§xKFind a degree sequence with a power law distribution, and minimum    value Ù¡jmin_degreeÙ§x*, which has approximate average degree    Ù¡naverage_degreeÙ§x . This is accomplished by either€ÙÇ‚Ù¹‚…Ù§kspecifying Ù¡jmin_degreeÙ§i and not Ù¡naverage_degreeÙ§a,€Ù¹‚…Ù§kspecifying Ù¡naverage_degreeÙ§i and not Ù¡jmin_degreeÙ§x>, in which       case a suitable minimum degree will be found.€Ù¹‚ŠÙ¡jmax_degreeÙ§x7 can also be specified, otherwise it will be set to    Ù¡anÙ§l. Each node Ù¨Ù§auÙ§k will have Ù£ƒs\mu \mathrm{deg}(u)ööÙ§xD edges    joining it to nodes in communities other than its own and Ù£ƒx(1 -
   \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)ööÙ§x3 edges joining it to nodes in its own    community.€Ù¹‚Ù§xPGenerate community sizes according to a power law distribution    with exponent Ù¡dtau2Ù§e. If Ù¡mmin_communityÙ§h and    Ù¡mmax_communityÙ§x2 are not specified they will be selected to be    Ù¡jmin_degreeÙ§e and Ù¡jmax_degreeÙ§xV, respectively.  Community sizes    are generated until the sum of their sizes equals Ù¡anÙ§a.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x“Each node will be randomly assigned a community with the    condition that the community is large enough for the node's    intra-community degree, Ù£ƒx(1 - \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)ööÙ§xµ as    described in step 2. If a community grows too large, a random node    will be selected for reassignment to a new community, until all    nodes have been assigned a community.€Ù¹‚‡Ù§jEach node Ù¨Ù§auÙ§k then adds Ù£ƒx(1 - \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)ööÙ§x    intra-community edges and Ù£ƒs\mu \mathrm{deg}(u)ööÙ§x inter-community    edges.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xNThis algorithm differs slightly from the original way it was presented in [1].€ÙÇ‚Ù¹‚Ù§xĞRather than connecting the graph via a configuration model then    rewiring to match the intra-community and inter-community    degrees, we do this wiring explicitly at the end, which should be    equivalent.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÿThe code posted on the author's website [2] calculates the random    power law distributed variables and their average using    continuous approximations, whereas we use the discrete    distributions here as both degree and community size are    discrete.€Ù¹‚Ù§xñThough the authors describe the algorithm as quite robust, testing during development indicates that a somewhat narrower parameter set is likely to successfully produce a graph. Some suggestions have been provided in the event of exceptions.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ŒÙ°ƒancintÙ¹‚Ù§x%Number of nodes in the created graph.€Ù°ƒdtau1efloatÙ¹‚Ù§xrPower law exponent for the degree distribution of the created graph.
