Let Ù¥sG' = (V, E \cup uv)Ù§f Then Ù¥ncc[s] = cc'[s]Ù§p if and only if Ù¥x'\left|dG(s, u) - dG(s, v)\right| \leq 1Ù§a.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§fWhere Ù¥hdG(u, v)Ù§xã denotes the length of the shortest path between two vertices u, v in a graph G, cc[s] is the closeness centrality for a vertex s in V, and cc'[s] is the closeness centrality for a vertex s in V, with the (u, v) edge added. ---€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§yuWe use Theorem 1 to filter out updates when adding or removing an edge. When adding an edge (u, v), we compute the shortest path lengths from all other nodes to u and to v before the node is added. When removing an edge, we compute the shortest path lengths after the edge is removed. Then we apply Theorem 1 to use previously computed closeness centrality for nodes where Ù¥x'\left|dG(s, u) - dG(s, v)\right| \leq 1Ù§x\. This works only for undirected, unweighted graphs; the distance argument is not supported.€Ù¹‚‰Ù§x Closeness centrality  of a node Ù£ƒauööÙ§xB is the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path distances from Ù£ƒauööÙ§h to all Ù£ƒcn-1ööÙ§x— other nodes. Since the sum of distances depends on the number of nodes in the graph, closeness is normalized by the sum of minimum possible distances Ù£ƒcn-1ööÙ§a.€Ù¤x=C ( u) = \frac { n - 1} { \sum_ { v=1}^ { n - 1} d ( v, u)}, Ù¹‚‰Ù§fwhere Ù£ƒgd(v, u)ööÙ§x' is the shortest-path distance between Ù£ƒavööÙ§e and Ù£ƒauööÙ§f, and Ù£ƒanööÙ§x% is the number of nodes in the graph.€Ù¹‚Ù§xBNotice that higher values of closeness indicate higher centrality.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚…Ù§x*The closeness centrality is normalized to Ù£ƒm(n-1)/(|G|-1)ööÙ§g where Ù£ƒanööÙ§xË is the number of nodes in the connected part of graph containing the node.  If the graph is not completely connected, this algorithm computes the closeness centrality for each connected part separately.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚…Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§pA NetworkX graph€Ù°ƒdedgeetupleÙ¹‚Ù§x&The modified edge (u, v) in the graph.€Ù°ƒgprev_ccjdictionaryÙ¹‚Ù§x=The previous closeness centrality for all nodes in the graph.€Ù°ƒiinsertionnbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xQIf True (default) the edge was inserted, otherwise it was deleted from the graph.€Ù°ƒkwf_improvedxbool, optional (default=True)Ù¹‚Ù§x«If True, scale by the fraction of nodes reachable.
