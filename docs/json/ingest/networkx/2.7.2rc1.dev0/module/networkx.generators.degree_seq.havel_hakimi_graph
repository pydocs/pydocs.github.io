The resulting graph has a high degree-associativity.  Nodes are labeled 1,.., len(deg_sequence), corresponding to their position in deg_sequence.€Ù¹‚Ù§xNThe basic algorithm is from Hakimi  and was generalized by Kleitman and Wang .€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒxdeg_sequence: list of integers`Ù¹‚Ù§xFEach integer corresponds to the degree of a node (need not be sorted).€Ù°ƒlcreate_usingx7NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)Ù¹‚Ù§xhGraph type to create.
