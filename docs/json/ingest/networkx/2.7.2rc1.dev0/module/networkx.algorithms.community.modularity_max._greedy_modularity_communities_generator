Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xíThis function performs Clauset-Newman-Moore greedy modularity maximization  At each step of the process it yields the change in modularity that will occur in the next step followed by yielding the new community partition after that step.€Ù¹‚Ù§xŞGreedy modularity maximization begins with each node in its own community and repeatedly joins the pair of communities that lead to the largest modularity until one community contains all nodes (the partition has one set).€Ù¹‚…Ù§x:This function maximizes the generalized modularity, where Ù¢„jresolutionÙ „ööelocaljresolutionelocalõÙ§x? is the resolution parameter, often expressed as $\gamma$.
