Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§yVoteRank  computes a ranking of the nodes in a graph G based on a voting scheme. With VoteRank, all nodes vote for each of its in-neighbours and the node with the highest votes is elected iteratively. The voting ability of out-neighbors of elected nodes is decreased in subsequent turns.€Ù¹‚Ù§x>Note: We treat each edge independently in case of multigraphs.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§qA NetworkX graph.€Ù°ƒonumber_of_nodesqinteger, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x6Number of ranked nodes to extract (default all nodes).€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒhvoterankdlistÙ¹‚Ù§xVOrdered list of computed seeds.
