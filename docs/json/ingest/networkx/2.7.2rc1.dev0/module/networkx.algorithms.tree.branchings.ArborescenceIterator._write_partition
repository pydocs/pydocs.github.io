Also, if one incoming edge is included, mark all others as excluded so that if that vertex is merged during Edmonds' algorithm we cannot still pick another of that vertex's included edges.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummaryjParametersx&networkx/algorithms/tree/branchings.py×r<class 'function'>x.networkx.ArborescenceIterator._write_partitionÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«x!_write_partition(self, partition)öxInetworkx.algorithms.tree.branchings.ArborescenceIterator._write_partition€
