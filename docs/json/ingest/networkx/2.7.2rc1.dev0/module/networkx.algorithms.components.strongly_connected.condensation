The node labels are integers corresponding to the index of the component in the list of strongly connected components of G.  C has a graph attribute named 'mapping' with a dictionary mapping the original nodes to the nodes in C to which they belong.  Each node in C also has a node attribute 'members' with the set of original nodes in G that form the SCC that the node in C represents.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xReturns the condensation of G.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö†gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnsfRaiseseNotesx4networkx/algorithms/components/strongly_connected.pyUr<class 'function'>unetworkx.condensationÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«xcondensation(G, scc=None)öx>networkx.algorithms.components.strongly_connected.condensation€
