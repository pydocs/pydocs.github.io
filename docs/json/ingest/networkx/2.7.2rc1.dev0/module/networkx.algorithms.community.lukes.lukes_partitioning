Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§yFThis algorithm partitions a connected, acyclic graph featuring integer node weights and float edge weights. The resulting clusters are such that the total weight of the nodes in each cluster does not exceed max_size and that the weight of the edges that are cut by the partition is minimum. The algorithm is based on LUKES[1].€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒaGegraph€Ù°ƒhmax_sizecintÙ¹‚Ù§xaMaximum weight a partition can have in terms of sum of node_weight for all nodes in the partition€Ù°ƒkedge_weightckeyÙ¹‚Ù§xHEdge data key to use as weight.
