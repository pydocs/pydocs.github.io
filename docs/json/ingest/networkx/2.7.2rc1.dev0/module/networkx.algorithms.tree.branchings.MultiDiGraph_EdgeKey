Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xIAdds a dictionary edge_index which maps edge keys to (u, v, data) tuples.€Ù¹‚Ù§yThis is not a complete implementation. For Edmonds algorithm, we only use add_node and add_edge, so that is all that is implemented here. During additions, any specified keys are ignored---this means that you also cannot update edge attributes through add_node and add_edge.€Ù¹‚Ù§xĞWhy do we need this? Edmonds algorithm requires that we track edges, even as we change the head and tail of an edge, and even changing the weight of edges. We must reliably track edges across graph mutations.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x5MultiDiGraph which assigns unique keys to every edge.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx&networkx/algorithms/tree/branchings.py£n<class 'type'>x-networkx.tree.branchings.MultiDiGraph_EdgeKeyÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«ööx8networkx.algorithms.tree.branchings.MultiDiGraph_EdgeKey€
