It then adds edge (v,w) and always increases the number of edges in graph G by one.€Ù¹‚Ù§yThe intelligence of the algorithm lies in the fact that  it is always possible to add an edge between disconnected nodes v and w, for which nkk[degree(v)][degree(w)] has not reached its target, even if one or both nodes do not have free stubs. If either node v or w does not have a free stub, we perform a "neighbor switch", an edge rewiring move that releases a free stub while keeping nkk the same.€Ù¹‚Ù§xàThe difference for the directed version lies in the fact that neighbor switches might not be able to rewire, but in these cases unsaturated nodes can be reassigned to use instead, see [1] for detailed description and proofs.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÑThe algorithm continues for E (number of edges in the graph) iterations of the "while loop", at which point all entries of the given nkk[k][l] have reached their target values and the construction is complete.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒjdegree_seqxlist of tuples (of size 3)Ù¹‚Ù§xPdegree sequence contains tuples of nodes with node id, in degree and out degree.€Ù°ƒcnkkx$dictionary of dictionary of integersÙ¹‚Ù§x directed joint degree dictionary, for nodes of out degree k (first level of dict) and nodes of in degree l (second level of dict) describes the number of edges.€Ù°ƒdseedxhashable object, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x!Seed for random number generator.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`mNetworkXErrorÙ¹‚Ù§xDIf degree_seq and nkk are not realizable as a simple directed graph.€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaGeGraphÙ¹‚Ù§x+A directed graph with the specified inputs.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x?Generates a random simple directed graph with the joint degree.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‡gSummaryjParametersgReturnsfRaiseseNotesjReferenceshExamplesx'networkx/generators/joint_degree_seq.pyŞr<class 'function'>x$networkx.directed_joint_degree_graphÙ¯‚Ù´ƒ˜HÙ±‚`jin_degreesÙ±‚`a Ù±‚aoa=Ù±‚`a Ù±‚`a[Ù±‚bmia0Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚bmia1Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚bmia1Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚bmia2Ù±‚`a]Ù±‚`a
