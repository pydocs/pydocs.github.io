If 6 couples go to a party, and each person shakes hands with every person except his or her partner, then this graph describes the set of handshakes that take place; for this reason it is also called the cocktail party graph .€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒlcreate_usingx7NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)Ù¹‚Ù§xGGraph type to create.
