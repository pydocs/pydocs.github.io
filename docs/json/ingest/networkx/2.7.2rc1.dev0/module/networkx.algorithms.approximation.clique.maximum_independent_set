Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yVIndependent set or stable set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. That is, it is a set I of vertices such that for every two vertices in I, there is no edge connecting the two. Equivalently, each edge in the graph has at most one endpoint in I. The size of an independent set is the number of vertices it contains .€Ù¹‚Ù§yZA maximum independent set is a largest independent set for a given graph G and its size is denoted $\alpha(G)$. The problem of finding such a set is called the maximum independent set problem and is an NP-hard optimization problem. As such, it is unlikely that there exists an efficient algorithm for finding a maximum independent set of a graph.€Ù¹‚Ù§x+The Independent Set algorithm is based on .€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚ƒÙ§mFinds the $O(ÙÉc|V|Ù§x7/(log|V|)^2)$ apx of independent set in the worst case.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graphÙ¹‚Ù§pUndirected graph€öfRaisesÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`vNetworkXNotImplementedÙ¹‚Ù§x,If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒdisetcSetÙ¹‚Ù§xThe apx-maximum independent set€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x/Returns an approximate maximum independent set.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‡gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnsfRaiseseNotesjReferencesx+networkx/algorithms/approximation/clique.pyr<class 'function'>x.networkx.approximation.maximum_independent_setÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«xmaximum_independent_set(G)öx@networkx.algorithms.approximation.clique.maximum_independent_set€
