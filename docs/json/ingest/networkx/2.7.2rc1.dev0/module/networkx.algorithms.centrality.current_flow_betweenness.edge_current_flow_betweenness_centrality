Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xŸCurrent-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current model for information spreading in contrast to betweenness centrality which uses shortest paths.€Ù¹‚Ù§xYCurrent-flow betweenness centrality is also known as random-walk betweenness centrality .€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yCurrent-flow betweenness can be computed in $O(I(n-1)+mn \log n)$ time , where $I(n-1)$ is the time needed to compute the inverse Laplacian.  For a full matrix this is $O(n^3)$ but using sparse methods you can achieve $O(nm{\sqrt k})$ where $k$ is the Laplacian matrix condition number.€Ù¹‚Ù§xwThe space required is $O(nw)$ where $w$ is the width of the sparse Laplacian matrix.  Worse case is $w=n$ for $O(n^2)$.€Ù¹‚Ù§xyIf the edges have a 'weight' attribute they will be used as weights in this algorithm.  Unspecified weights are set to 1.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚…Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§pA NetworkX graph€Ù°ƒjnormalizedxbool, optional (default=True)Ù¹‚Ù§xdIf True the betweenness values are normalized by 2/[(n-1)(n-2)] where n is the number of nodes in G.€Ù°ƒfweightx'string or None, optional (default=None)Ù¹‚Ù§x‘Key for edge data used as the edge weight.
