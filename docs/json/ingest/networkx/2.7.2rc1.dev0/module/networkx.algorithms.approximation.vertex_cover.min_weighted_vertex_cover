Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xÕThe set of nodes returned by this function is guaranteed to be a vertex cover, and the total weight of the set is guaranteed to be at most twice the total weight of the minimum weight vertex cover. In other words,€Ù¤xw ( S) \leq 2 * w ( S^*), Ù¹‚Ù§xèwhere $S$ is the vertex cover returned by this function, $S^*$ is the vertex cover of minimum weight out of all vertex covers of the graph, and $w$ is the function that computes the sum of the weights of each node in that given set.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xàFor a directed graph, a vertex cover has the same definition: a set of nodes such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one node in the set. Whether the node is the head or tail of the directed edge is ignored.€Ù¹‚Ù§y*This is the local-ratio algorithm for computing an approximate vertex cover. The algorithm greedily reduces the costs over edges, iteratively building a cover. The worst-case runtime of this implementation is $O(m \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the graph.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graph€Ù°ƒfweightx!string, optional (default = None)Ù¹‚Ù§x•If None, every node has weight 1.
