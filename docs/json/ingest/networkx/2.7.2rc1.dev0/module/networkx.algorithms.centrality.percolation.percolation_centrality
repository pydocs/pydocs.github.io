Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§xˆPercolation centrality of a node $v$, at a given time, is defined as the proportion of â€˜percolated pathsâ€™ that go through that node.€Ù¹‚Ù§x~This measure quantifies relative impact of nodes based on their topological connectivity, as well as their percolation states.€Ù¹‚Ù§ygPercolation states of nodes are used to depict network percolation scenarios (such as during infection transmission in a social network of individuals, spreading of computer viruses on computer networks, or transmission of disease over a network of towns) over time. In this measure usually the percolation state is expressed as a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0.€Ù¹‚Ù§xeWhen all nodes are in the same percolated state this measure is equivalent to betweenness centrality.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§x‰The algorithm is from Mahendra Piraveenan, Mikhail Prokopenko, and Liaquat Hossain  Pair dependecies are calculated and accumulated using€Ù¹‚Ù§xFor weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero. Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length paths between pairs of nodes.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§qA NetworkX graph.€Ù°ƒiattributex0None or string, optional (default='percolation')Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xAName of the node attribute to use for percolation state, used if Ù¢„fstatesÙ „ööelocalfstateselocalõÙ§i is None.€Ù°ƒfstatesx%None or dict, optional (default=None)Ù¹‚Ù§xISpecify percolation states for the nodes, nodes as keys states as values.€Ù°ƒfweightx'None or string, optional (default=None)Ù¹‚Ù§xÀIf None, all edge weights are considered equal.
