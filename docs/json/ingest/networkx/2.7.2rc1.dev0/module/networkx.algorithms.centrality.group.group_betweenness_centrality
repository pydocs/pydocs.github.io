Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xGroup betweenness centrality of a group of nodes $C$ is the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through any vertex in $C$€Ù¤xIc_B ( v) =\sum_ { s,t \in V} \frac { \sigma ( s, t|v)} { \sigma ( s, t)} Ù¹‚Ù§ywhere $V$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of shortest $(s, t)$-paths, and $\sigma(s, t|C)$ is the number of those paths passing through some node in group $C$. Note that $(s, t)$ are not members of the group ($V-C$ is the set of nodes in $V$ that are not in $C$).€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§xÅGroup betweenness centrality is described in  and its importance discussed in . The initial implementation of the algorithm is mentioned in . This function uses an improved algorithm presented in .€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xBThe number of nodes in the group must be a maximum of n - 2 where Ù£ƒanööÙ§x+ is the total number of nodes in the graph.€Ù¹‚Ù§xFor weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero. Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length paths between pairs of nodes.€Ù¹‚…Ù§yKThe total number of paths between source and target is counted differently for directed and undirected graphs. Directed paths between "u" and "v" are counted as two possible paths (one each direction) while undirected paths between "u" and "v" are counted as one path. Said another way, the sum in the expression above is over all Ù¡fs != tÙ§x for directed graphs and for Ù¡es < tÙ§w for undirected graphs.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚…Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§qA NetworkX graph.€Ù°ƒaCx,list or set or list of lists or list of setsÙ¹‚Ù§x{A group or a list of groups containing nodes which belong to G, for which group betweenness centrality is to be calculated.€Ù°ƒjnormalizedxbool, optional (default=True)Ù¹‚‡Ù§x,If True, group betweenness is normalized by Ù£ƒx1/((|V|-|C|)(|V|-|C|-1))ööÙ§g where Ù£ƒc|V|ööÙ§x! is the number of nodes in G and Ù£ƒc|C|ööÙ§x is the number of nodes in C.€Ù°ƒfweightx'None or string, optional (default=None)Ù¹‚Ù§xÀIf None, all edge weights are considered equal.
