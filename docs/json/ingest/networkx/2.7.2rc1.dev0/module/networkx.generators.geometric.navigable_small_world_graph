Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xqA navigable small-world graph is a directed grid with additional long-range connections that are chosen randomly.€Ù·xI[...] we begin with a set of nodes [...] that are identified with the setx,of lattice points in an $n \times n$ square,xC$\{(i, j): i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\}$,xCand we define the *lattice distance* between two nodes $(i, j)$ andx=$(k, l)$ to be the number of "lattice steps" separating them:x($d((i, j), (k, l)) = |k - i| + |l - j|$.`xFFor a universal constant $p >= 1$, the node $u$ has a directed edge toxCevery other node within lattice distance $p$---these are its *localx@contacts*. For universal constants $q >= 0$ and $r >= 0$ we alsoxEconstruct directed edges from $u$ to $q$ other nodes (the *long-rangexHcontacts*) using independent random trials; the $i$th directed edge fromxF$u$ has endpoint $v$ with probability proportional to $[d(u,v)]^{-r}$.`g-- [1]_ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚†Ù°ƒancintÙ¹‚Ù§x[The length of one side of the lattice; the number of nodes in the graph is therefore $n^2$.€Ù°ƒapcintÙ¹‚Ù§xpThe diameter of short range connections.
