Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§xxEach unionFind instance X maintains a family of disjoint sets of hashable objects, supporting the following two methods:€ÙÈÙ¹‚Ù§yX[item] returns a name for the set containing the given item.   Each set is named by an arbitrarily-chosen one of its members; as   long as the set remains unchanged it will keep the same name. If   the item is not yet part of a set in X, a new singleton set is   created for it.€ÙÈ‚Ù¹‚Ù§xÃX.union(item1, item2, ...) merges the sets containing each item   into a single larger set.  If any item is not yet part of a set   in X, it is added to X as one of the members of the merged set.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÔUnion-find data structure.
