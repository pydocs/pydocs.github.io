Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xĞA spanner of a graph G = (V, E) with stretch t is a subgraph H = (V, E_S) such that E_S is a subset of E and the distance between any pair of nodes in H is at most t times the distance between the nodes in G.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xKThis function implements the spanner algorithm by Baswana and Sen, see [1].€Ù¹‚Ù§y¾This algorithm is a randomized las vegas algorithm: The expected running time is O(km) where k = (stretch + 1) // 2 and m is the number of edges in G. The returned graph is always a spanner of the given graph with the specified stretch. For weighted graphs the number of edges in the spanner is O(k * n^(1 + 1 / k)) where k is defined as above and n is the number of nodes in G. For unweighted graphs the number of edges is O(n^(1 + 1 / k) + kn).€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graphÙ¹‚Ù§xAn undirected simple graph.€Ù°ƒgstretchefloatÙ¹‚Ù§xThe stretch of the spanner.€Ù°ƒfweightfobjectÙ¹‚Ù§x&The edge attribute to use as distance.€Ù°ƒdseedx(integer, random_state, or None (default)Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x1Indicator of random number generation state.
