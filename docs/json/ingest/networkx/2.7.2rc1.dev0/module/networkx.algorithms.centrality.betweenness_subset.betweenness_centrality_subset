If $s = t$, $\sigma(s, t) = 1$, and if $v \in {s, t}$, $\sigma(s, t|v) = 0$ .€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚†Ù¹‚Ù§xThe basic algorithm is from .€Ù¹‚Ù§xFor weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero. Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length paths between pairs of nodes.€Ù¹‚Ù§x·The normalization might seem a little strange but it is designed to make betweenness_centrality(G) be the same as betweenness_centrality_subset(G,sources=G.nodes(),targets=G.nodes()).€Ù¹‚Ù§xşThe total number of paths between source and target is counted differently for directed and undirected graphs. Directed paths are easy to count. Undirected paths are tricky: should a path from "u" to "v" count as 1 undirected path or as 2 directed paths?€Ù¹‚Ù§xYFor betweenness_centrality we report the number of undirected paths when G is undirected.€Ù¹‚Ù§y·For betweenness_centrality_subset the reporting is different. If the source and target subsets are the same, then we want to count undirected paths. But if the source and target subsets differ -- for example, if sources is {0} and targets is {1}, then we are only counting the paths in one direction. They are undirected paths but we are counting them in a directed way. To count them as undirected paths, each should count as half a path.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚…Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§qA NetworkX graph.€Ù°ƒvsources: list of nodes`Ù¹‚Ù§x9Nodes to use as sources for shortest paths in betweenness€Ù°ƒvtargets: list of nodes`Ù¹‚Ù§x9Nodes to use as targets for shortest paths in betweenness€Ù°ƒjnormalizednbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xIf True the betweenness values are normalized by $2/((n-1)(n-2))$ for graphs, and $1/((n-1)(n-2))$ for directed graphs where $n$ is the number of nodes in G.€Ù°ƒfweightx'None or string, optional (default=None)Ù¹‚Ù§xËIf None, all edge weights are considered equal.
