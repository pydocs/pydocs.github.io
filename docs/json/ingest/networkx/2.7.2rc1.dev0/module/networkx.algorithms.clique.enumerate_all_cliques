Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xËThis function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a list of nodes. The iteration is ordered by cardinality of the cliques: first all cliques of size one, then all cliques of size two, etc.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x%To obtain a list of all cliques, use Ù£ƒxlist(enumerate_all_cliques(G))ööÙ§y,. However, be aware that in the worst-case, the length of this list can be exponential in the number of nodes in the graph (for example, when the graph is the complete graph). This function avoids storing all cliques in memory by only keeping current candidate node lists in memory during its search.€Ù¹‚Ù§xkThe implementation is adapted from the algorithm by Zhang, et al. (2005)  to output all cliques discovered.€Ù¹‚Ù§xsThis algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges, since cliques are not conventionally defined with such edges.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graphÙ¹‚Ù§tAn undirected graph.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`hiteratorÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x>An iterator over cliques, each of which is a list of nodes in Ù¢„aGÙ „ööelocalaGelocalõÙ§x,.
