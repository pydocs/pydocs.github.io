For PageRank to converge to a unique solution (i.e., a unique stationary distribution in a Markov chain), the transition matrix must be irreducible. In other words, it must be that there exists a path between every pair of nodes in the graph, or else there is the potential of "rank sinks."€Ù¹‚Ù§xšThis implementation works with Multi(Di)Graphs. For multigraphs the weight between two nodes is set to be the sum of all edge weights between those nodes.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚†Ù°ƒaGegraphÙ¹‚Ù§x|A NetworkX graph.

At least one personalization value must be non-zero. If not specfiied, a nodes personalization value will be zero. By default, a uniform distribution is used.€Ù°ƒhnodelistnlist, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x…The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in nodelist. If nodelist is None, then the ordering is produced by G.nodes().€Ù°ƒfweightmkey, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x>Edge data key to use as weight.  If None weights are set to 1.€Ù°ƒxdangling: dict, optional`Ù¹‚Ù§yÖThe outedges to be assigned to any "dangling" nodes, i.e., nodes without any outedges. The dict key is the node the outedge points to and the dict value is the weight of that outedge. By default, dangling nodes are given outedges according to the personalization vector (uniform if not specified) This must be selected to result in an irreducible transition matrix (see notes below). It may be common to have the dangling dict to be the same as the personalization dict.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaAlNumPy matrixÙ¹‚Ù§xGoogle matrix of the graph€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x'Returns the Google matrix of the graph.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö…gSummaryjParametersgReturnseNoteshSee Alsox1networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/pagerank_alg.py­r<class 'function'>vnetworkx.google_matrixÙ¯‚€öƒÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒhpagerankx7networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerankõ€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒnpagerank_numpyx=networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank_numpyõ€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒnpagerank_scipyx=networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank_scipyõ€öm2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«xagoogle_matrix(G, alpha=0.85, personalization=None, nodelist=None, weight='weight', dangling=None)öx<networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.google_matrix€
