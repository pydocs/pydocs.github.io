Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚†Ù¹‚Ù§y	The semantic feasibility function should return True if it is acceptable to add the candidate pair (G1_node, G2_node) to the current partial isomorphism mapping.   The logic should focus on semantic information contained in the edge data or a formalized node class.€Ù¹‚Ù§yBy acceptable, we mean that the subsequent mapping can still become a complete isomorphism mapping.  Thus, if adding the candidate pair definitely makes it so that the subsequent mapping cannot become a complete isomorphism mapping, then this function must return False.€Ù¹‚Ù§xŒThe default semantic feasibility function always returns True. The effect is that semantics are not considered in the matching of G1 and G2.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÔThe semantic checks might differ based on the what type of test is being performed.  A keyword description of the test is stored in self.test.  Here is a quick description of the currently implemented tests::    €ÙÀy}test='graph'
  Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a graph-graph
  isomorphism.

test='subgraph'
  Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a subgraph-graph
  isomorphism such that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

test='mono'
  Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a subgraph-graph
  monomorphism such that a subgraph of G1 is monomorphic to G2.Ù¹‚Ù§x¤Any subclass which redefines semantic_feasibility() must maintain the above form to keep the match() method functional. Implementations should consider multigraphs.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xCReturns True if adding (G1_node, G2_node) is symantically feasible.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryx.networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/isomorphvf2.pyAr<class 'function'>xBnetworkx.isomorphism.isomorphvf2.GraphMatcher.semantic_feasibilityÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«x,semantic_feasibility(self, G1_node, G2_node)öxMnetworkx.algorithms.isomorphism.isomorphvf2.GraphMatcher.semantic_feasibility€
