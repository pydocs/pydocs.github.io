This is equivalent to saying that the subgraph induced by C is complete (in some cases, the term clique may also refer to the subgraph).€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x^A maximum clique is a clique of the largest possible size in a given graph. The clique number Ù£ƒi\omega(G)ööÙ§x¤ of a graph G is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in G. The intersection number of G is the smallest number of cliques that together cover all edges of G.€Ù¹‚Ù§x,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_clique€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒaGnNetworkX graphÙ¹‚Ù§pUndirected graph€öfRaisesÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`vNetworkXNotImplementedÙ¹‚Ù§x,If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒfcliquecsetÙ¹‚Ù§x#The apx-maximum clique of the graph€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§wFind the Maximum Clique€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‡gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnsfRaiseseNotesjReferencesx+networkx/algorithms/approximation/clique.py@r<class 'function'>x!networkx.approximation.max_cliqueÙ¯‚€ö€m2.7.2rc1.dev0Ù«mmax_clique(G)öx3networkx.algorithms.approximation.clique.max_clique€
