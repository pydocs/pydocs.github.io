Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚…Ù§dThe Ù¨Ù§schain decompositionÙ§y	 of a graph with respect a depth-first search tree is a set of cycles or paths derived from the set of fundamental cycles of the tree in the following manner. Consider each fundamental cycle with respect to the given tree, represented as a list of edges beginning with the nontree edge oriented away from the root of the tree. For each fundamental cycle, if it overlaps with any previous fundamental cycle, just take the initial non-overlapping segment, which is a path instead of a cycle. Each cycle or path is called a Ù¨Ù§echainÙ§x. For more information, see .€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xiThe worst-case running time of this implementation is linear in the number of nodes and number of edges .€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒaGpundirected graph€Ù°ƒdrootonode (optional)Ù¹‚ƒÙ§tA node in the graph Ù¢„aGÙ „ööelocalaGelocalõÙ§x¬.
