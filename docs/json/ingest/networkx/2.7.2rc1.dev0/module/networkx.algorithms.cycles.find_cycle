When set to 'reverse' every edge is traversed in the reverse direction. When set to 'ignore', every edge is treated as undirected. When set to 'original', every edge is treated as directed. In all three cases, the yielded edge tuples add a last entry to indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed. If orientation is None, the yielded edge has no direction indicated. The direction is respected, but not reported.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚Ù°ƒ`oNetworkXNoCycleÙ¹‚Ù§vIf no cycle was found.€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒeedgesndirected edgesÙ¹‚Ù§x—A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop.

For graphs, an edge is of the form Ù£ƒf(u, v)ööÙ§g where Ù£ƒauööÙ§e and Ù£ƒavööÙ§xk are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal. For multigraphs, an edge is of the form Ù£ƒk(u, v, key)ööÙ§h, where Ù£ƒckeyööÙ§x: is the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then Ù£ƒauööÙ§e and Ù£ƒavööÙ§x½ are always in the order of the actual directed edge. If orientation is not None then the edge tuple is extended to include the direction of traversal ('forward' or 'reverse') on that edge.€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x0Returns a cycle found via depth-first traversal.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‡gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnsfRaiseshExampleshSee Alsoxnetworkx/algorithms/cycles.pyPr<class 'function'>snetworkx.find_cycleÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yÏIn this example, we construct a DAG and find, in the first call, that there are no directed cycles, and so an exception is raised. In the second call, we ignore edge orientations and find that there is an undirected cycle. Note that the second call finds a directed cycle while effectively traversing an undirected graph, and so, we found an "undirected cycle". This means that this DAG structure does not form a directed tree (which is also known as a polytree).€Ù´ƒ˜/Ù±‚`aGÙ±‚`a Ù±‚aoa=Ù±‚`a Ù±‚`bnxÙ±‚aoa.Ù±‚`Ù¢„gDiGraphÙ „hnetworkxm2.7.2rc1.dev0fmodulex networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraphfmoduleõÙ±‚`a(Ù±‚`a[Ù±‚`a(Ù±‚bmia0Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚bmia1Ù±‚`a)Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚`a(Ù±‚bmia0Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚bmia2Ù±‚`a)Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚`a(Ù±‚bmia1Ù±‚`a,Ù±‚`a Ù±‚bmia2Ù±‚`a)Ù±‚`a]Ù±‚`a)Ù±‚`a
