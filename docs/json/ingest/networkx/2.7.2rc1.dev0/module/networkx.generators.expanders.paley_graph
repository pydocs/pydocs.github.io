Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§xpThe returned graph is a graph on Z/pZ with edges between x and y if and only if x-y is a nonzero square in Z/pZ.€Ù¹‚Ù§x™If p = 1 mod 4, -1 is a square in Z/pZ and therefore x-y is a square if and only if y-x is also a square, i.e the edges in the Paley graph are symmetric.€Ù¹‚Ù§xlIf p = 3 mod 4, -1 is not a square in Z/pZ and therefore either x-y or y-x is a square in Z/pZ but not both.€Ù¹‚Ù§yVNote that a more general definition of Paley graphs extends this construction to graphs over q=p^n vertices, by using the finite field F_q instead of Z/pZ. This construction requires to compute squares in general finite fields and is not what is implemented here (i.e paley_graph(25) does not return the true Paley graph associated with 5^2).€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒapxint, an odd prime number.€Ù°ƒlcreate_usingx7NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)Ù¹‚Ù§xGGraph type to create.
