Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§ybPairwise or local node connectivity between two distinct and nonadjacent nodes is the minimum number of nodes that must be removed (minimum separating cutset) to disconnect them. By Menger's theorem, this is equal to the number of node independent paths (paths that share no nodes other than source and target). Which is what we compute in this function.€Ù¹‚Ù§x¼This algorithm is a fast approximation that gives an strict lower bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes . It works for both directed and undirected graphs.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒaGnNetworkX graph€Ù°ƒqnbunch: container`Ù¹‚Ù§xfContainer of nodes.
