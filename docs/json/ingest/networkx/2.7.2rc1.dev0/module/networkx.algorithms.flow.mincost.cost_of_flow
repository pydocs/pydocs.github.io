As a workaround you can use integer numbers by multiplying the relevant edge attributes by a convenient constant factor (eg 100).€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒaGnNetworkX graphÙ¹‚Ù§xKDiGraph on which a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands is to be found.€Ù°ƒfweightfstringÙ¹‚Ù§xÓEdges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute weight that indicates the cost incurred by sending one unit of flow on that edge.
