Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚ƒÙ§xuThe instance of this class may be used as the default value assigned to a keyword if no other obvious default (e.g., Ù¡dNoneÙ§n) is suitable,€Ù¹‚Ù§x*Common reasons for using this keyword are:€ÙÈ‚Ù¹‚‹Ù§x¢A new keyword is added to a function, and that function forwards its   inputs to another function or method which can be defined outside of   NumPy. For example, Ù¡inp.std(x)Ù§g calls Ù¡ex.stdÙ§l, so when a Ù¡hkeepdimsÙ§xU   keyword was added that could only be forwarded if the user explicitly   specified Ù¡hkeepdimsÙ§xN; downstream array libraries may not have added   the same keyword, so adding Ù¡xx.std(..., keepdims=keepdims)Ù§x=   unconditionally could have broken previously working code.€Ù¹‚Ù§xiA keyword is being deprecated, and a deprecation warning must only be   emitted when the keyword is used.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§vSpecial keyword value.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryr/numpy/_globals.py<n<class 'type'>xnumpy._globals._NoValueTypeÙ¯‚€ö€f1.22.3Ù«ööxnumpy._globals._NoValueType€
