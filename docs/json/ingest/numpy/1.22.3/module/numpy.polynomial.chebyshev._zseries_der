This scaling has been compensated by multiplying the value of zs by two also so that the two cancels in the division.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚Ù°ƒbzshz-seriesÙ¹‚Ù§xThe z-series to differentiate.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒjderivativehz-seriesÙ¹‚Ù§nThe derivative€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xDifferentiate a z-series.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö…gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnseNotesx/numpy/polynomial/chebyshev.pyr<class 'function'>x'numpy.polynomial.chebyshev._zseries_derÙ¯‚€ö€f1.22.3Ù«p_zseries_der(zs)öx'numpy.polynomial.chebyshev._zseries_der€
