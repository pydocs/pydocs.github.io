The most basic usage is for an element of the files argument sequence to be a simple filename. This will cause that file from the local path to be installed to the installation path of the self.name package (package path). The file argument can also be a relative path in which case the entire relative path will be installed into the package directory. Finally, the file can be an absolute path name in which case the file will be found at the absolute path name but installed to the package path.€Ù¹‚Ù§yóThis basic behavior can be augmented by passing a 2-tuple in as the file argument. The first element of the tuple should specify the relative path (under the package install directory) where the remaining sequence of files should be installed to (it has nothing to do with the file-names in the source distribution). The second element of the tuple is the sequence of files that should be installed. The files in this sequence can be filenames, relative paths, or absolute paths. For absolute paths the file will be installed in the top-level package installation directory (regardless of the first argument). Filenames and relative path names will be installed in the package install directory under the path name given as the first element of the tuple.€Ù¹‚Ù§xRules for installation paths:€Ù·Œx.#. file.txt -> (., file.txt)-> parent/file.txtx=#. foo/file.txt -> (foo, foo/file.txt) -> parent/foo/file.txtxA#. /foo/bar/file.txt -> (., /foo/bar/file.txt) -> parent/file.txtx*#. ``*``.txt -> parent/a.txt, parent/b.txtx8#. foo/``*``.txt`` -> parent/foo/a.txt, parent/foo/b.txtxL#. ``*/*.txt`` -> (``*``, ``*``/``*``.txt) -> parent/c/a.txt, parent/d/b.txtx)#.
