Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§xİNormally in numpy >= 1.14, assignment of one structured array to another copies fields "by position", meaning that the first field from the src is copied to the first field of the dst, and so on, regardless of field name.€Ù¹‚Ù§x÷This function instead copies "by field name", such that fields in the dst are assigned from the identically named field in the src. This applies recursively for nested structures. This is how structure assignment worked in numpy >= 1.6 to <= 1.13.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚ƒÙ°ƒcdstgndarray€Ù°ƒcsrcgndarrayÙ¹‚Ù§x4The source and destination arrays during assignment.€Ù°ƒozero_unassignednbool, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xÀIf True, fields in the dst for which there was no matching field in the src are filled with the value 0 (zero). This was the behavior of numpy <= 1.13.
