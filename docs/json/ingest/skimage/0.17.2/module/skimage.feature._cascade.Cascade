The second advantage of cascade classifier is that easy examples can be classified only by evaluating some of the classifiers in the cascade, making the process much faster than the process of evaluating a one strong classifier.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xCClass for cascade of classifiers that is used for object detection.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€öƒgSummarypExtended SummaryjAttributesx./skimage/feature/_cascade.cpython-39-darwin.soön<class 'type'>wskimage.feature.CascadeÙ¯‚€ö€f0.17.2Ù«ööx skimage.feature._cascade.Cascade€
