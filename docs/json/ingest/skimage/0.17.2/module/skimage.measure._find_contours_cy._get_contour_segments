If such a segment is found, its coordinates are added to a growing list of segments, which is returned by the function.  if vertex_connect_high is nonzero, high-values pixels are considered to be face+vertex connected into objects; otherwise low-valued pixels are.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryööx$<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>x4skimage.measure._find_contours._get_contour_segmentsÙ¯‚€ö€f0.17.2Ù«ööx7skimage.measure._find_contours_cy._get_contour_segments€
