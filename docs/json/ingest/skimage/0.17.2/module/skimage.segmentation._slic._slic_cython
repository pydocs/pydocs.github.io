However, in 3D image analysis, 'z' is usually the "special" dimension, with, for example, a different effective resolution than the other two axes. Therefore, x and y are often processed together, or viewed as a cut-plane through the volume. So, if the order was (x, y, z) and we wanted to look at the 5th cut plane, we would write::      €ÙÀxmy_z_plane = img3d[:, :, 5]Ù¹‚Ù§x½but, assuming a C-contiguous array, this would grab a discontiguous slice of memory, which is bad for performance. In contrast, if we see the image as (z, y, x) ordered, we would do::      €ÙÀumy_z_plane = img3d[5]Ù¹‚Ù§xcand get back a contiguous block of memory. This is better both for performance and for readability.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‰Ù°ƒiimage_zyxx)4D array of np_floats, shape (Z, Y, X, C)Ù¹‚Ù§pThe input image.€Ù°ƒdmaskx+3D array of bool, shape (Z, Y, X), optionalÙ¹‚Ù§oThe input mask.€Ù°ƒhsegmentsx'2D array of np_floats, shape (N, 3 + C)Ù¹‚Ù§x:The initial centroids obtained by SLIC as [Z, Y, X, C...].€Ù°ƒdstepinp_floatsÙ¹‚Ù§x1The size of the step between two seeds in voxels.€Ù°ƒhmax_itercintÙ¹‚Ù§x)The maximum number of k-means iterations.€Ù°ƒgspacingx!1D array of np_floats, shape (3,)Ù¹‚Ù§xThe voxel spacing along each image dimension.
