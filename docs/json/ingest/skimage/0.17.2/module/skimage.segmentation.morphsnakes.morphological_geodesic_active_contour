Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x—Geodesic active contours implemented with morphological operators. It can be used to segment objects with visible but noisy, cluttered, broken borders.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§yThis is a version of the Geodesic Active Contours (GAC) algorithm that uses morphological operators instead of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for the evolution of the contour. The set of morphological operators used in this algorithm are proved to be infinitesimally equivalent to the GAC PDEs (see ). However, morphological operators are do not suffer from the numerical stability issues typically found in PDEs (e.g., it is not necessary to find the right time step for the evolution), and are computationally faster.€Ù¹‚Ù§x?The algorithm and its theoretical derivation are described in .€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‡Ù°ƒfgimagex(M, N) or (L, M, N) arrayÙ¹‚‰Ù§xõPreprocessed image or volume to be segmented. This is very rarely the original image. Instead, this is usually a preprocessed version of the original image that enhances and highlights the borders (or other structures) of the object to segment.

If an array is given, it will be binarized and used as the initial level set. If a string is given, it defines the method to generate a reasonable initial level set with the shape of the Ù£ƒeimageööÙ§xL. Accepted values are 'checkerboard' and 'circle'.

Reasonable values are around 1-4. Larger values lead to smoother segmentations.€Ù°ƒithresholdofloat, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§xAreas of the image with a value smaller than this threshold will be considered borders. The evolution of the contour will stop in this areas.€Ù°ƒgballoonofloat, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§yFBalloon force to guide the contour in non-informative areas of the image, i.e., areas where the gradient of the image is too small to push the contour towards a border. A negative value will shrink the contour, while a positive value will expand the contour in these areas. Setting this to zero will disable the balloon force.€Ù°ƒmiter_callbackrfunction, optionalÙ¹‚Ù§x½If given, this function is called once per iteration with the current level set as the only argument. This is useful for debugging or for plotting intermediate results during the evolution.€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚Ù°ƒcoutx(M, N) or (L, M, N) arrayÙ¹‚Ù§x.Final segmentation (i.e., the final level set)€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§x2Morphological Geodesic Active Contours (MorphGAC).€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‡gSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersgReturnshSee AlsoeNotesjReferencesx$/skimage/segmentation/morphsnakes.pyhr<class 'function'>x:skimage.segmentation.morphological_geodesic_active_contourÙ¯‚€öƒÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒvcheckerboard_level_setx7skimage.segmentation.morphsnakes.checkerboard_level_setõ€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒpcircle_level_setöö€öÙ¼ƒÙ»ƒxinverse_gaussian_gradientx:skimage.segmentation.morphsnakes.inverse_gaussian_gradientõ€öf0.17.2Ù«x¬morphological_geodesic_active_contour(gimage, iterations, init_level_set='circle', smoothing=1, threshold='auto', balloon=0, iter_callback=<function <lambda> at 0x0000000>)öxFskimage.segmentation.morphsnakes.morphological_geodesic_active_contour€
