An illegal shape is (3, 1, 4), and correct one is (1, 3, 4) or (1, 4, 3). The point is to have all 1s of the shape at the beginning, not in the middle of the shape tuple.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö‚gSummarypExtended Summaryööx$<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>x$skimage.measure._ccomp.reshape_arrayÙ¯‚€ö€f0.17.2Ù«ööx$skimage.measure._ccomp.reshape_array€
