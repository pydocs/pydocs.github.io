These are useful for interpreting the Ù¢„itracebackÙ „itracebacka*capiitracebackfmoduleõÙ§x+ array returned by the find_costs() method.€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚ƒÙ¹‚Ù§yïGiven an n-d costs array, this class can be used to find the minimum-cost path through that array from any set of points to any other set of points. Basic usage is to initialize the class and call find_costs() with a one or more starting indices (and an optional list of end indices). After that, call traceback() one or more times to find the path from any given end-position to the closest starting index. New paths through the same costs array can be found by calling find_costs() repeatedly.€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§xHThe cost of a path is calculated simply as the sum of the values of the Ù¢„ecostsÙ „ööelocalecostselocalõÙ§xÂ array at each point on the path. The class MCP_Geometric, on the other hand, accounts for the fact that diagonal vs. axial moves are of different lengths, and weights the path cost accordingly.€Ù¹‚Ù§xArray elements with infinite or negative costs will simply be ignored, as will paths whose cumulative cost overflows to infinite.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒecostsgndarray€Ù°ƒgoffsetsriterable, optionalÙ¹‚ƒÙ§xâA list of offset tuples: each offset specifies a valid move from a given n-d position.
