Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚„Ù¹‚Ù§ycThe two images are rectified such that every pixel in the left image has its corresponding pixel on the same scanline in the right image. That means that both images are warped such that they have the same orientation but a horizontal spatial offset (baseline). The ground-truth pixel offset in column direction is specified by the included disparity map.€Ù¹‚Ù§yThe two images are part of the Middlebury 2014 stereo benchmark. The dataset was created by Nera Nesic, Porter Westling, Xi Wang, York Kitajima, Greg Krathwohl, and Daniel Scharstein at Middlebury College. A detailed description of the acquisition process can be found in .€Ù¹‚ƒÙ§x¤The images included here are down-sampled versions of the default exposure images in the benchmark.
