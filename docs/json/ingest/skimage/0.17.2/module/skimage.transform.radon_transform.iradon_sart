Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xReconstruct an image from the radon transform, using a single iteration of the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) algorithm.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§y'Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques are based on formulating the tomography reconstruction problem as a set of linear equations. Along each ray, the projected value is the sum of all the values of the cross section along the ray. A typical feature of SART (and a few other variants of algebraic techniques) is that it samples the cross section at equidistant points along the ray, using linear interpolation between the pixel values of the cross section. The resulting set of linear equations are then solved using a slightly modified Kaczmarz method.€Ù¹‚Ù§xÆWhen using SART, a single iteration is usually sufficient to obtain a good reconstruction. Further iterations will tend to enhance high-frequency information, but will also often increase the noise.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‡Ù°ƒkradon_imageh2D arrayÙ¹‚…Ù§x¶Image containing radon transform (sinogram). Each column of the image corresponds to a projection along a different angle. The tomography rotation axis should lie at the pixel index Ù¡xradon_image.shape[0] // 2Ù§x along the 0th dimension of Ù¡kradon_imageÙ§a.€Ù°ƒethetar1D array, optionalÙ¹‚ƒÙ§xgReconstruction angles (in degrees).

A higher value can improve the convergence rate, but one runs the risk of instabilities.
