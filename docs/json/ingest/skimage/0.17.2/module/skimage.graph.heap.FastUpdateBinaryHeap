Ùª­jAttributesÙ¯‚„Ù°ƒecountcintÙ¹‚Ù§x The number of values in the heap€Ù°ƒflevelscintÙ¹‚Ù§x¯The number of levels in the binary heap (see Notes below). The values are stored in the last level, so 2**levels is the capacity of the heap before another resize is required.€Ù°ƒjmin_levelscintÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x9The minimum number of levels in the heap (relates to the Ù¢„pinitial_capacityÙ „ööelocalpinitial_capacityelocalõÙ§l parameter.)€Ù°ƒmmax_referencecintÙ¹‚Ù§x;The provided or calculated maximum allowed reference value.€öpExtended SummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xùThis heap class keeps cross-references so that the value associated with a given reference can be quickly queried (O(1) time) or updated (O(log2(N)) time). This is ideal for pathfinding algorithms that implement some variant of Dijkstra's algorithm.€ögMethodsÙ¯‚€öeNotesÙ¯‚‚Ù¹‚Ù§x¹The cross-references map data[reference]->internalindex, such that the value corresponding to a given reference can be found efficiently. This can be queried with the value_of() method.€Ù¹‚Ù§xóA special method, push_if_lower() is provided that will update the heap if the given reference is not in the heap, or if it is and the provided value is lower than the current value in the heap. This is again useful for pathfinding algorithms.€öpOther ParametersÙ¯‚€öjParametersÙ¯‚‚Ù°ƒpinitial_capacitycintÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x“Estimate of the size of the heap, if known in advance. (In any case, the heap will dynamically grow and shrink as required, though never below the Ù¢„pinitial_capacityÙ „ööelocalpinitial_capacityelocalõÙ§b.)€Ù°ƒmmax_referencemint, optionalÙ¹‚ƒÙ§x…Largest reference value that might be pushed to the heap. (Pushing a larger value will result in an error.) If no value is provided, Ù£ƒr1-initial_capacityööÙ§y9 will be used. For the cross-reference index to work, all references must be in the range [0, max_reference]; references pushed outside of that range will not be added to the heap. The cross-references are kept as a 1-d array of length `max_reference+1', so memory use of this heap is effectively O(max_reference)€öfRaisesÙ¯‚€öhReceivesÙ¯‚€ögReturnsÙ¯‚€ögSummaryÙ¯‚Ù¹‚Ù§xGBinary heap that allows the value of a reference to be updated quickly.€öhWarningsÙ¯‚€öeWarnsÙ¯‚€öfYieldsÙ¯‚€ö†iSignaturegSummarypExtended SummaryjParametersjAttributeseNotesx(/skimage/graph/heap.cpython-39-darwin.soön<class 'type'>x'skimage.graph.heap.FastUpdateBinaryHeapÙ¯‚€ö€f0.17.2Ù«x>FastUpdateBinaryHeap(initial_capacity=128, max_reference=None)öx'skimage.graph.heap.FastUpdateBinaryHeap€
